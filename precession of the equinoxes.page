It's well known that Earth's orbit's angle to the ecliptic is 23.4°. However, the axis itself "wobbles", i.e. the north pole rotates to the west in a circle of radius 23.5° every 26000 years. Because of this [coordinates of stars](celestial sphere) change and in a few thousand years the Pole Star will no longer be the pole star! Currently the intersection of celestial meridian and [vernal equinox](equinox) is in the constellation of Pisces, around the year 2600 it will enter Aquarius -- hence the name "age of Aquarius".

In the time Egiptian pyramids were built Polaris was not above the north pole, and understanding of this is used in dating Egyptian artifacts.
