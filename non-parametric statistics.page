An alternative to [parametric statistics]() that do not assume any characteristics structure of the data ([normal distribution]() etc.). These cover alternative procedures for common parametric procedures:

* [correlation](inter-item correlation): e.g. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
* [regression](linear regression)
* [t-tests](t-test): Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxan's signed-rank test
* [ANOVA](): Kruskal-Wallis one-way, Friedman two-way
* [chi-square tests](): Fisher's exact test, McNemar's test

## Examples

### Wilcoxan's ranking method

Null hypothesis: median difference between pairs is 0 (median is a better measure of central tendency than mean for distributions that are not normal).

       Red   White  Sign    ABS    rank  s*r
-----  ----  ----- ------  -----  ----  ----
1      65    60     -1      5      1     -1
2      60    70     +1      10     2      2
3      65    80     +1      15     3      3
4      85    65     -1      20     4     -4

if s*r sums to 0 then we maintain the null hypothesis.

In R: `wilcox.test(fance.red, fance.white, paired=TRUE)`; `V` value is the sum of s*r.

### Mann-Whitney U test

Just a modification of Wilcoxan's procedure.

Arrange all the observations, regardless of group, into a single ranked series

* R = sum of ranks from one group
* U = sum - R

If U value is ~ 1/2 of the highest possible sum ($\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$) then we maintain null hypothesis.

In R: `wilcox.test(autraslia.white, france.white, paired=FALSE)`. p-value tells us if null hypothesis holds.
