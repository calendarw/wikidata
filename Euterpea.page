A DSL based on Haskell for creating computer music and for algorithmic composition.

## Quick Start

### Basic Sound Generation

~~~
> git clone https://github.com/dwincort/Euterpea
> cd Euterpea
> cabal-dev install
> cabal-dev ghci
ghci> :l Euterpea/Examples/SoundCheck.hs
ghci> test sawtooth
~~~

this will produce `test.wav` file that could then be played externally.

### Sequencing

Have a look at `Examples/Interlude.hs`, which contains the first couple of bars of Chick Corea's _Child Song 6_. It can be rendered as wav with `Examples/MusicToSignal.lhs`. To 

## Setup for MIDI

Assuming Euterpea has been set up as per _Quick Start_ section above:

* start `qsynth`
* start `qjackctl` and in _Connect_ screen connect _Midi Through_ to _FLUID Synth_
* in `ghci` load `Euterpea/Examples/EuterpeaExamples.hs` and execute examples `t0` through to `t5`
