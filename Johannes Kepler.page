Assistant of Tycho Brache. First proposed the model where plantes move alongside elliptical orbits.

## First Law

Planets move alongside elliptical orbits with one focus being the sun.

## Second Law

The area of ellipse corresponding to the part of the orbit completed in a unit of time is constant.

## Third Law

For all planets in the solar system:

$P^2=Ka^3$

* $P$ -- the period (around the Sun)
* $a$ -- the length of semimajor axis
* $K$ -- a constant

This formula can be used to link the mass orbital period and distance of the moon with the mass of the body it orbits; $K$ should then be taken to be $\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}$.
