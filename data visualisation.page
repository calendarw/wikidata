## Visual Attributes

### Usage with data types

Bertin in _Semiology of Graphics_ introduced a classification of attributes that can be used to present data:

* position -- suitable for nominal, ordered and quantitative data
* size -- suitable for nominal, ordered and quantitative data
* value -- suitable for nominal, ordered and to lesser extent quantitative data
* texture -- suitable for nominal and to a lesser extent ordered data
* colour -- nominal only
* orientation -- nominal only
* shape -- nominal only

### Perceptual properties

From most to least easily perceptible by humans:

* position
* length
* angle and slope
* area
* volume
* colour and density

It's a good practice to use the most easily distinguishable values for most important variables.
