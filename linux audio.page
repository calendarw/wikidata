## Setting up Jack to suspend PulseAudio

In `QjackCtl`, in _Setup..._ set _server prefix_ to `pasuspender -- /usr/bin/jackd`. But does it help that much?

## Recording from seq24

* using QjackCtl connect the Midi Through port to synth inputs
* run `ecasound -i:jack -o:foo.wav`
* again, in QjackCtl connect the outputs of the synths to ecasound's `in_1` and `in_2`
* play the song in seq24
* stop ecasound

## Overtone

* set up a project as per [instructions](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-overtone)
* set up Sublime Text to use Sublime REPL and Ctrl+Enter to evaluate current block in REPL (this is in my checked-in Sublime config)
