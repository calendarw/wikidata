A distributed directory service. Each node in the directory is identified by a path (`/node1/node2/.../nodeN`) and has some data associated with it. There's a hard limit of 1MB per node, typically it's meant to be much less. Each server holds a copy of the entire directory in memory. Clients connect to one of the servers and deal only with it, unless it goes offline. The service insists on a consistent view of the data held.
