## Introduction

*Andres LÃ¶h, 9 April 2013*

Haskell programmers are encouraged to declare lots of datatypes. However, there is a cost associated with it: our custom types cannot be compared for equality, serialised, traversed etc. There is a solution for that: `deriving`, that works for:

* `Eq`
* `Ord`
* `Enum`
* `Bounded`
* `Read`
* `Show`

plus GHC extensions:

* `Functor`
* `Traversable`
* `Typeable`
* `Data`
* `Generic`

That is a limited set. What about serialisation/deserialisation, where implementation of typeclasses is typically obvious (i.e. can be expressed as an algorithm) for a given datatype? Some solutions:

* Template Haskell
* `data-derive`
* use GHC `Generic`

The last option is what we'll discuss.

## Usage

Step 1: `deriving Generic`

~~~ {.haskell}
data MyType a b = Flag Bool 
                | Combo (a, a) 
                | Other b Int (MyType a a)
  deriving Generic
~~~

Step 2: empty instance declaration for the class we want:

~~~ {.haskell}
import Data.Binary

instance (Binary a, Binary b) => Binary (MyType a b)
~~~

## How `deriving` works

~~~ {.haskell}
class Eq' a where
  eq :: a -> a -> Bool

data Choice = I Int | C Char | B Choice Bool | S Choice

instance Eq' Choice where
  eq (I n1) (I n2) = eq n1 n2
  eq (B c1 b1) (B c2 b2) = eq c1 c2 && eq b1 b2
  -- ...
  eq _      _      = False

data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

instance Eq' a => Eq' (Tree a) where
 -- ....

~~~

Pattern:

* the `eq` definition has as many cases as there are constructors + 1
* it returns true if constructor has no arguments
* recursion leads to recursion
* parametrisation of types leads to parametrisation of functions

How do we write a program to do this?

## Interlude: type isomorphisms

Types `A` and `B` are isomorphic if we have

* `f :: A -> B`
* `g :: B -> A`

such that `f . g = id` and `g . f = id`.

~~~ {.haskell}
data SnocList a = Lin | SnocList a :> a

listToSnocList [] = Lin
iistToSnocList (x : xs) = listToSnocList xs :> x

-- snocListToList analaguous
~~~

## Implementation of `Generic`

The idea of datatype generic programming:

Represent type `A` as isomorphic type `Rep A`. If a limited number of type constructors is used to build `Rep A` then functions defined on each of these type constructors can be lifted to work on teh original type `A`.

What constructors do we use to encode an arbitrary data type?

* `Either a b` encodes choice between two constructors; this can be nested to encode choice with more options
* `(a, b)` encodes combination of two fields; this can be nested for arbitrary number of arguments
* `()` can be used to represent constructors without arguments -- they don't carry any information

for clarity, we'll use types isomorphic to these:

~~~ {.haskell}
data U = U
data a :+: b = L a | R b
data a :*: b = a :*: b
~~~

now we can specify generic:

~~~ {.haskell}
class Generic a where
  type Rep a
  from :: a -> Rep a
  to   :: Rep a -> a
~~~

An instance for `Bool` would then look as follows:

~~~ {.haskell}
instance Generic Bool where
  type Rep Bool = U :+: U

  from False = L U
  from True = R U

  to (L U) = False
  to (R U) = True
~~~

and for lists:

~~~ {.haskell}
instance Generic [a] where
  type Rep [a] = U :+: (a :*: [a]) -- note: we are not recursively expanding!
  -- ...
~~~

thanks to non-recursion the conversion functions are non-recursive.

But: what do we do with primitive types? We don't -- that's the limit to genericity -- we simply have to give instances for those types.

Given that, we can define generic functions on the 

~~~ {.haskell}
class GEq -- ...

intance (GEq a, GEq b) => GEq (a :+: b) where
  geq (L x) (L y) = geq x y
  geq (R x) (R y) = geq x y
  geq _     _     = False

instance (GEq a, GEq b) => GEq (a :*: b) where
  geq (a1 :*: b1) (a2 :*: b2) = geq a1 a2 && geq b1 b2

instance GEq U where
  geq U = True
~~~

What remains is lifting the generic functions to function that works on the original type:

~~~ {.haskell}
defaultEq :: (Generic a Geq (Rep a)) => a -> a -> Bool
defaultEq x y = geq (from x) (from y)
~~~

now:

~~~ {.haskell}
instance GEq Bool where
  geq = defaultEq

instance GEq [a] where
  geq = defaultEq
~~~

using `DefaultSignatures` language extension we can end up with empty instance declarations.

## Advantages

We have replaced tedious work of defining equality for every type with defining representation for every type. But thisiven a representation, we can define many generic functions that operate on this single representation.

## `DeriveGeneric`

We can use `DeriveGeneric`, but we'll end up with more complicated representation than suggested above...

~~~ {.haskell}
class Generic a where
  type Rep a : * -> *
  -- ...
~~~

additional type parameter on Rep is a technicality that allows us to derive classes parameterised by type constructors, such as Functor. We can see actual type using `:kind! (Rep (Tree ())))` in ghci -- it has the original structure, but enriched with meta-information that says e.g. whether record syntax has been used. This all enables extra features that we don't need for generic equality, but we would need e.g. for `Show` (constructor names, record syntax etc.).

Encoding meta-information:

~~~ {.haskell}
data U1 a = U1
-- ...
newtype K1 t c a = 1 { unK1 :: c }
data P -- marks parameters
data R -- marks other occurrences

newtype M1 t i f a = M1 { unM1 : f a }

class Datatype d where
  datatypeName :: w d f a -> String
  moduleName :: w d f a -> String
-- ...
~~~

We can adapt `GEq'` and `GEq` to this representation.

Q: why do we have to write `deriving Generic`? Why is it not derived for every data type?

A: it does not work for some (very few) data types; also, it leaks abstraction.

Q: can we derive it for datatype defined elsewhere?

A: yes, using `StandaloneDeriving`.

## `Generic1`

To cover classes such as `Functor`, `Traversable` or `Foldable` we need to use `Generic1` -- this is deriving as well.

## Examples

Look at the sources of `generic-deriving` package -- it contains re-implementation of all main type classes using `Generic`.

## Conclusion

* safer, but less powerful than Template Haskell
* for user of libraries: less boilerplate, easy to use
* for library author: consider using this!

Q: how does it relate to `Data` typeclass?

A: it's an alternative solution, based on *[scrap your boilerplate]()*; note: `Data` cannot be derived using `Generic` (the only other example is `Typeable`). `Generic` is very well suited to automatic deriving, SYB is suitable for other use cases such as traversal.

Q: does it support GADTs?

A: no; i.e. it can be used for types that use GADT syntax as long as they are not actually GADTs.

Q: will it ever work with kind polymorphism (`Generic`, `Generic1`, ...)?

A: kind polymorphism is itself very new, so difficult to tell. But we can be hopeful: the representation used internally by GHC can be very complex and we don't have to worry about it.

Q: can we write our own `Generic` instance instead of using `deriving Generic`?

A: yes, and it's much safer than e.g. writing custom `Typeable` (GHC will prevent us from defining `Typeable` instances)
