*Proper motion* of stars is the motion over and above the [parallax]() osciallation. Tangential velocity can be measured by observing the proper motion:

$v_T=4.74\mu D_{pc}$

Where $\mu$ is the proper movement in arcseconds per year. Radial velocity (towards/away from the [Sun]()) can be calculated from [Doppler effect]() ([redshift]()):

$v_r=c(\lambda/\lambda_0-1)$
