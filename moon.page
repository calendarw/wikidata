## Formation

Likely produced by a giant impact early in the Earth history -- something of the size of Mars crashed into the Earth and bits of the mantle were ejected into space. That's why Moon is poor in iron. This is corroborated by the following facts:

* the mineral composition of the Moon is similar to Earth's mantle
* it is an unusually large satellite

According to the model behind this theory before the crash Earth was spinning very fast, with day shorter than 3 hours. After the collision it started slowing down. Another consequence is that the Moon would be receding from Earth and indeed, this has been confirmed by reflectors left by the astronauts on Moon surface. The recession speed is about 3 cm per year.

## Surface

Maria were thought to be oceans, actually they are lava flows. They are only present on the near side, it's not clear why. Maria surface is mostly smooth, so it appears they are younger than most of the surface.

## Internal Structure

Like [Earth]() the moon has solid inner core and molten outer core, but they are very small and do not generate a magnetic field.
