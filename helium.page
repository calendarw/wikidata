## On Earth

The Earth has too little mass to retain atmosphere of helium. Helium being light rises to the [exosphere]() where its temperature (up to around 1800K) and low mass mean that according to [ideal gas law](https://notepad.mmakowski.com/temperature#ideal-gas) it achieves velocity close to [escape velocity]() and leaks out. It also does not bind into chemical molecules so is not retained this way.

All of the primodial helium is gone from Earth. What remains is a product of [radioactive decay](nuclear decay) that is the source of Earth's internal heat.
