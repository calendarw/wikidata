Damaged two wheels -- buckled rims after hitting a kerb. Candidate repair shops found recommended on forums:

Also need to replace two tyres. National was about 20% more expensive than black circles.

Ordered tyres at Black Circles and had them sent to Alloy Weldcraft.

### Insurance

My excess is Â£1350, so claiming in this case will most likely not be worth losing the no claims bonus. The up side would be that the insurer arranges everything about the repair, but if they can do that, so a garage should be able to.
