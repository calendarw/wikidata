A technique used in P2P networks where each node has a unique id assigned and there is a simple function that maps every key from a given key space to a node id. Resources can in turn be associated with keys, so when a node wants to access a resource it finds the node  among its peers who is closest to the node responsible for the resource and passes the request to it. 

An example:

Node 92402221 requests resource with key a342d392. It checks which of its peers has the id that has largest prefix in common with the key, finds a9491239 and passes the request ot it. a9491239 does the same and finds a348b342. a348b342 knows that it's responsible for the key and responds directly to 92402221.

Can be used to implement [distributed hash tables](Distributed Hash Table)
