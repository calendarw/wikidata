Hard planet to study because of thick cloud layer. The atmosphere is 100 times more dense than that of Earth and consists mostly of CO2 and SO2. SO2 is what forms clouds, the rain is sulphuric acid, Venera lander survived for 25 minutes before it was struck by lightning and succumbing to the acid. There is massive greenhouse effect resulting in 730K temperature all around the globe.

Has retrograde spin, possibly as a result of a collision in the early days of the [solar system]().

There is no magnetism, perhaps because its core has largely solidified.
