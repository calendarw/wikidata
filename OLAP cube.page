## Overview

A piece of software that allows reporting on data that is categorised along multiple dimensions. Each piece of data (*measure*) is has a number of attributes, whose values are members of dimensions (axes). For example given a fact:

a *£13m* *GBP* *swap* maturing in *August 2020* where the counterparty is *Vodafone* is worth *-£3k*

if we take *-£3k* as the measure, we can distinguis the following five dimensions:

* nominal (£13m)
* currency (GBP)
* product type (swap)
* maturity (August 2020)
* counterparty (Vodafone)

The values of dimensions can be further organised into hierarchies, e.g. 

~~~ {.asciiart}
2020
|
+- Q3
   |
   +- August
~~~

## Terminology

measure
:   an atomic, scalar value that is categorised across a number of dimensions
dimension
:   a label assigned to one axis of the cube
slicing
:   selecting a specific value of one dimension
dicing
:   selecting a specific value (or a range of values?) of a number of dimensions
drill down
:   navigation from the summarised figures to details
roll up
:   summarising detailed figures into higher level figures, e.g. along the dimension hierarchy, but can also be done according to a custom formula

## Querying

A de-facto standard for querying OLAP cubes is [MDX]().
