A piece of software that allows reporting on data that is categorised along multiple dimensions. Each piece of data (*measure*) is has a number of attributes, whose values are members of dimensions. For example given a fact:

a *£13m* *GBP* *swap* maturing in *August 2020* where the counterparty is *Vodafone* is worth *-£3k*

if we take *-£3k* as the measure, we can distinguis the following dimensions:

* nominal (£13m)
* currency (GBP)
* product type (swap)
* maturity (August 2020)
* counterparty (Vodafone)
