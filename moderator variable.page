In [statistics](), a variable $Z$ that explains the relationship between the independent variable $X$ and dependent variable $Y$; i.e. the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is a function of $Z$. In case of [linear regression](), where we have the equation:

$Y = B_0 + B_1X + e$

in the presence of moderating variable $Z$ $B_1$ is not constant but a function of $Z$, so the equation becomes:

$Y = B_0 _ B_1(Z)X + e$
