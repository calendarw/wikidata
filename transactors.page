A term used within [Akka framework](http://akkasource.org) for an actor that makes use of [Software Transactional Memory](). In Akka, the messages passed between actors are immutable unless they are ''Ref''s -- these can be mutated by using a ''swap()'' method. Mutation of ''Ref''s can only be done within a transaction scope, and for a transactor the ''receive'' block defines such a scope.
