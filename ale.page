### 8-Ball

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Rye IPA
**strength**  6.2%
**brewery**   Beavertown Brewery
------------  ---------------

Very unusual taste, apparently due to use of rye. Like American IPA, but with burnt flavour underneath.

### Amarillo

**strength**  5.0%

Drank once, at Wat Tyler Folk Festival in 2010, liked it at the time. In 2013 tried it bottled and was disappointed by lack of character.

### Arctic Ale

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Porter
**strength**  10.0%
**brewery**   Elveden Ales
------------  ---------------

Very dark, very sweet, very strong, very expensive -- for special occasions. Trevor had the brewer over one Saturday so I decided to give it a go. That's a beer to drink on its own, not with food. Very heavy bottle with cork that requires a corkskrew, unlike [Mayflower Gold](#mayflower-gold).

### Brewer's Gold

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   Crouch Vale
------------  ---------------

First tried at The Bell in Horndon on The Hill. Very light, hoppy, smells of elderflower. Often buy bottled at Tesco Langdon Hills. The version sold under Marks & Spencer brand tasted much worse.

### Citra

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  3.9%
**brewery**   Crouch Vale
------------  ---------------

I finally learned the hops that produce my favourite ale aroma: american Citra. This limited edition ale is full of them and most excellent as a result. Got it first from Billericay Brewing Co., then ordered 10 bottles via [Ales By Mail](http://www.alesbymail.co.uk/). Some of them were not as aromatic as the first bottle I tried.

### Citra, Chinook, Columbus

**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale
**strength**  7.4%
**brewery**   Partizan Brewing
------------  ---------------

First bought from Billericay Brewing Co., a very nice American style ale with strong hop aroma dominated by my favourite citra.

### Curious

### Craft Magic

**type**      IPA
**strength**  2.6%
**brewery**   Magic Rock
------------  ---------------

First tried at [The Cask](http://www.caskpubandkitchen.com/). Extremely hoppy, resembles American IPAs. "Session IPA" brewed especially for Craft Beer (the owners of The Cask).

### Dead Pony Club

### EPA

**rating**    * * * *

**strength**  3.6%
**brewery**   Marston's

Bought bottled in Tesco. Light and hoppy, very nice, prefer it to [Old Empire](#old-empire).

### Fade to Black

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  6.3%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

Like a cross of American IPA (very pungent) and stout (very dark, burnt). Lovely. Expensive, bought it at Billericay shop.

### Gamma Ray

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale
**strength**  5.4%
**brewery**   Beavertown Brewery
------------  ---------------

Excellent American style pale, with citra and galaxy. The latter hops seem to add a lot of bitterness.

### Golden Crust

**type**      ?

**brewery**   The Wolf Brewery

Bought bottled in Tesco. Malt and honey, darkish, not hoppy, but pleasant.

### Great Eastern IPA

**type**      American IPA

Sweet and hoppy, very nice.

### Grisette Citra

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  4.1%
**brewery**   Partizan Brewing
------------  ---------------

Recommended by Trevor from Billericay Brewing Co. Nice, but the hop aroma is too faint for my taste. "Grisette" beers from Partizan seem to have the "Saison" taste.

### Hara-Kiri

**type**      Experimental

Unusual, rhye based. The brewers compare the taste to dry sherry.

### Harvest Pale

**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  4.3%
**brewery**   Castle Rock

Bought bottled in Tesco. Very pale, really bitter and aromatic. Ania likes it.

### Hopping Hare

A bottled regular. Probably the nicest Badger beer.

### Inferno

Drank at [The Cask](http://www.caskpubandkitchen.com/), very hoppy.

### Kernel IPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  7.0%
**brewery**   The Kernel Brewery London
------------  ---------------

Lovely hops composition: Simcoe, Amarillo, Nelson Sauvin. Overall [Kernel Pale Ale](#kernel-pale-ale) costs the same for a bigger bottle and tastes as good.

### Kernel Pale Ale

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  5.1%
**brewery**   The Kernel Brewery London
------------  ---------------

Recommended by Trevor from Billericay Brewing Co., after being asked for very hoppy beers containing citra. Did not disappoint. The initial variant I tried included citra and galaxy hops. Later version added cascade to this mix, which seemed to make the ale milder -- but it's still excellent.

### Landlord

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * *
**type**      Bitter
**strength**  4.3%
**brewery**   Timothy Taylor

When drank first time in Angel I quite liked it, but last attempt, in The Pheasant pub in Northumberland, was pretty bad.

### Little Things that Kill

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      Session IPA
**strength**  3.8%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

A perfect mix of high hop and low alcohol content. In taste resembles [Kernel Pale](#kernel-pale-ale). The label states that the mix of hops can change according to brewers' whim.

### Mayflower Gold

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  6.5%
**brewery**   Billericay Brewing Company
------------  ---------------

Bought at Billericay Farmer's Market. Bottle with Champagne cork. Not particularly aromatic, but very bitter, also quite sweet. A nice debut from new local microbrewery.

### Nelson Saison

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Saison
**strength**  6.9%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

Bought at Essex Beer Shop. It appears saison yeast is responsible for what I recognise as the belgian taste. Yeast seems the most dominant, as in other beers of this type.

### Old Crafty Hen

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Strong Ale
**strength**  6.0% ?
**brewery**   Morland

Not too much hops, but big, malty taste and deep colour.

### Old Empire

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  5.7%
**brewery**   Marston's
------------  ---------------

One of my bottled regulars. Comparable to *[Old Golden Hen](#old-golden-hen)* and *[Hopping Hare](#hopping-hare)*. Hoppy smell, but not so much in the taste -- it's sweetish. EPA is nicer.

### Old Golden Hen

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA

Only drank bottled. Nice and hoppy, but uneven -- some bottles seemed markedly less aromatic.

### Old Speckled Hen

Only choose it if there are no other ales available.

### Prairie Standard

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Saison
**strength**  5.2%
**brewery**   Krebs Brewing
------------  ---------------

Doesn't say anywhere that it uses saison yeast, but tastes very much as if it does. Not good for Ania.

### Punk IPA

**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   BrewDog

Nice, but not as nice as [Dead Pony Club](#dead-pony-club) from the same brewery. Available canned at Byron and bottled at Cat and Canary.

### Red Kite

**type**      Bitter
**strength**  4.5%

Tried on tap at Pheasant Inn in Stannersburn. Nothing special, but nicer than the alternative, *[Landlord](#landlord)*.

### Suze V

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Amber Ale
**strength**  4.1%
**brewery**   Vens Brewing Co

Got it from Billericay Brewing Co. Strong, unusual aroma.

### Tesco Finest American Double IPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    *
**type**      American IPA

Very sweet, undrinkable. Also sold as *Hardcore IPA*.

### Tribute

Popular bottled. Initial impression seemed to be hoppy, but last time I tried it seemed overwhelmingly malty, not very nice.
