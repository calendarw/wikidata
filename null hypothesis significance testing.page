Assume that there is no correlation calculate the probability of observing data that we gathered in experiments given there is no correlation. If the probability is very low (e.g. <0.05) then reject the null hypothesis, otherwise carry on with it.

## Problems

* samples size bias: $p \sim \frac{1}{t}$, $t \sim \frac{1}{SE}$, $SE \sim \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}$ (see [standard error]()) so a very large $n$ will lead to rejection of null hypothesis.
* the cut-off value (0.05) is arbitrary

## In R

~~~ {.r}
cor.test(df$col1, df$col2)
~~~
