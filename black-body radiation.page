Hot object radiates. For dense dark objects radiation is completely characterised by temperature.

## Wien's Law

$\lambda_{max}T=b$

where $b=2.9\times 10^{-3} mK$

So hotter objects emit shorter wave length radiation (light).

## Stefan-Boltzmann Relation

$F=\sigma T^4$

$F$ -- flux of an object (rate of radiation), in Watts per $m^2$.

$\sigma=5.67\times 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2K^4}$
