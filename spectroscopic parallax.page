Technique used to calculate distance to stars which are too far for [parallax]() measurement. Typical error is around 10%.

## Example 

How to calculate the distance to Alphecca (dim white star)?

$b_{\alpha CB}=2.63\times10^{-12}b_{sun}$ (via photometric measurement)

spectrum classifies it as A0V, so $T_{\alpha CB}=9700K$

luminosity (From [H-R](main sequence stars)): $L_{\alpha CB}=74L_{sun}$

Now we can calculate distance:

$D_{\alpha CB}=\sqrt{\frac{L_{\alpha CB}}{L_{sun}}\ \frac{b_{sun}}{b_{\alpha CB}}}AU=25.7pc$

And radius:

$R_{\alpha CB} = \left(\frac{L_{\alpha CB}}{L_{sun}}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{T_{\alpha CB}}{T_{sun}}\right)^{-2} = 3R_{sun}$
