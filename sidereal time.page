The time measured by rotation of Earth with respect to the stars.

Solar day is longer than sidereal day: if solar day is measured between noon and noon (i.e. when a given observer has sun in the apogee) then during that time the Earth would have made more than 360 degrees rotation -- that's because Earth orbits the Sun at the same time!

Sidereal day: 23h 56m 4s.

Once a year there is a day (by convention, 21st September) when sidereal clock agrees with solar clock.
