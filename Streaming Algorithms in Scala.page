# Making Big Data Small: Streaming Algorithms in Scala

2012-09-12, Noel Welsh

**B**ig **D**ata? That is Hadoop and map/reduce. We're talking here about something different: data sets bigger than our resources can handle in one go.

### Demands

* scalable
* reak time (not batch, like Hadoop)
* simple to implement

### Streaming Algorithms

* process data in one pass
* have small space requirements (e.g. O(log(log n)))
* limited computation requirements per item (typically O(1))

But:

* give approximate answers

### Hash Functions

* deterministic
* uniform distribution
* bit values are independent (any subset of bits is equally good approximation)

In practice, use Murmur Hash 3. Scala 2.10 provides `scala.util.hashing`, look into Guava if we more algorithms are needed.
