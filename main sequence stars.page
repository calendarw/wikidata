In a scatterplot of star [temperature]() vs. [luminosity]() (Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) most of the stars lie along a diagonal going from hot and luminous stars to cool and dim ones. This is called *main sequence*.

*Red giants*: above main sequence: Large, hence more luminous than main sequence stars of comparable tempereature.

*White dwarfs*: below main sequence. Small, hence not that luminous for their temperature.

## Mass-Luminosity Relation

$\frac{L}{L_{sun}}=\left(\frac{M}{M_{sun}}\right)^{3.5}$

As a result, big stars run out of hydrogen much faster. Conclusion: large, hot stars are very young since their total lifetime is tens of millions of years.

## Structure of Heat Transfer

Depends on the mass:

* < 0.5 solar masses: convection throughout the star
* 0.5 to 1.5 solar masses: radiation in the core, convection outside
* > 1.5 solar masses: convection in the core, radiation outside
