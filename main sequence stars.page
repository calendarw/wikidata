In a scatterplot of star [temperature]() vs. [luminosity]() most of the stars lie along a diagonal going from hot and luminous stars to cool and dim ones. This is called *main sequence*.

*Red giants*: above main sequence: Large, hence more luminous than main sequence stars of comparable tempereature.

*White dwarfs*: below main sequence. Small, hence not that luminous for their temperature.
