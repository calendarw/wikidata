In a scatterplot of star [temperature]() vs. [luminosity]() ([Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]()) most of the stars lie along a diagonal going from hot and luminous stars to cool and dim ones. This is called *main sequence*. Some 85% of know stars are on this sequence. It is a wide strip because rotation speed, composition, presence of binary partner etc. affect luminosity and surface temperature.

*Red giants*: above main sequence: Large, hence more luminous than main sequence stars of comparable tempereature.

*White dwarfs*: below main sequence. Small, hence not that luminous for their temperature.

It is estimated that main sequence stars can form from gas clouds of mass between 0.7 and 265 solar masses. Below 0.7 a [brown dwarf]() would form, above 265 the radiation pressure would fragment the cloud. The upper limit is still pushed higher, recent discovery of R136A in Tarantula Nebula in [Large Magellanic Cloud]() has pushed it to 265.

The evolution can be observed in star clusters, where the formation starts at the same point in time but more massive stars evolve much faster.

## Mass-Luminosity Relation

$\frac{L}{L_{sun}}=\left(\frac{M}{M_{sun}}\right)^{3.5}$

As a result, big stars run out of hydrogen much faster. Conclusion: large, hot stars are very young since their total lifetime is tens of millions of years.

## Structure of Heat Transfer

Depends on the mass:

* < 0.5 solar masses: convection throughout the star
* 0.5 to 1.5 solar masses: radiation in the core, convection outside
* more than 1.5 solar masses: convection in the core, radiation outside

## Expansion

As the hydrogen is used up the core contracts and becomes hydrogen-depleted (richer in helium). As a result the fusion decreases, but due to $PV=Nk_BT$ and number of particles decreasing (fusion!) the pressure in the core decreases. As it happens, the outer layers contract the material in the core to a smaller radius, which as a result of [Kelvin-Helmholtz processes]() heats up, until fusion rate increases enough to hold up the rest of the star. As the hydrogen from outer layers is accreted to the core the envolope and [luminosity]() increases.

Sun is now 25% brighter than when it formed. In 1-3 billion years the Earth will become unhabitable (provided the orbit will remain stable until then!).

## Collapse

A relatively straightforward calculation shows that core larger than 0.08 of total mass of the star can no longer support the outer layers and collapses.
