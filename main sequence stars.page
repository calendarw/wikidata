In a scatterplot of star [temperature]() vs. [luminosity]() ([Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]()) most of the stars lie along a diagonal going from hot and luminous stars to cool and dim ones. This is called *main sequence*. Some 85% of know stars are on this sequence.

*Red giants*: above main sequence: Large, hence more luminous than main sequence stars of comparable tempereature.

*White dwarfs*: below main sequence. Small, hence not that luminous for their temperature.

## Mass-Luminosity Relation

$\frac{L}{L_{sun}}=\left(\frac{M}{M_{sun}}\right)^{3.5}$

As a result, big stars run out of hydrogen much faster. Conclusion: large, hot stars are very young since their total lifetime is tens of millions of years.

## Structure of Heat Transfer

Depends on the mass:

* < 0.5 solar masses: convection throughout the star
* 0.5 to 1.5 solar masses: radiation in the core, convection outside
* more than 1.5 solar masses: convection in the core, radiation outside

## Expansion

As the hydrogen is used up the core contracts and becomes hydrogen-depleted (richer in helium). As a result the fusion decreases, but due to $PV=Nk_BT$ and number of particles decreasing (fusion!) the pressure in the core decreases. As it happens, the outer layers contract the material in the core to a smaller radius, which as a result of [Kelvin-Helmholtz processes]() heats up, until fusion rate increases enough to hold up the rest of the star. As the hydrogen from outer layers is accreted to the core the envolope and [luminosity]() increases.

Sun is now 25% brighter than when it formed. In 1-3 billion years the Earth will become unhabitable (provided the orbit will remain stable until then!).
