Interaction between the satellite and the body it orbits whereby the rotational frequency is related to orbiting frequency so that only one side of one or both of the bodies is exposed to the other body at all times (e.g. moon to Earth). This is due to the body being not symmetrical, but elongated by gravitational force, and the torque thus exerted by that force.
