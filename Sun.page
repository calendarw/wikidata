## Structure

### Observing

Helioseismology: shifts in [spectra](spectroscopy) tell us how different regions fluctuate and move with respect to one another.

### Regions

#### Core

to 1/4 of the radius. Temperatures 15-16 million K. Density of Hydrogen: 150 times the density of water. Contains 40% of the mass of the Sun. It is in stable equilibrium, because when the rate of fusion decreases the core cools, contracts, the gravity increases and rate of fusion increases. *Luminosity is determined by how much they hydrogen is compressed, ie. the total mass of a star*.

#### Radiation Zone
 
between .25R  and .7 R. Consists of [plasma](). Temperature 2 million K. Energy transfer mode: radiation diffusion: gamma rays from core are absorbed and reemitted and reabsorbed and reemitted... it takes a photon 170 000 years to travel through this region.

#### Convection Zone (Photosphere)

Between .7 to 1R. Temperature decreases to 5700 K at the surface and density decreases from density of water to near zero. Plasma becomes opaque and the most efficient mode of heat transfer is through convection cells. That's why the surface appears granular. The cells have sizes of thousands of kilometers.

#### Chromosphere

h <= 2000 km. Temperature rises to 50 thousand K. Very tenuous and not visible.

#### Corona

h between 200 km and 1.3 R

Temperature of 2 million K. Best visible in UV and X-Ray. Source of the [solar wind]().

## Weather

Spots on the Sun are an indication. They are depressions in the surface. There is an 11 year cycle in variation of number of sunspots. The are regions of intense magnetic field that stops the convection. They are cooler than the rest of the surface, down to 4000 K. Where do they come from?

At the start of the cycle the magnetic field on the sun is orderly and polar. However, the equator rotates faster than the pole (Sun is fluid). As a result the magnetic field lines are stretched like rubber bands, form loops of charged particles, creates sun spots, it all becomes a mess, and after 11 years the polar magnetic field is reinstated with reversed polarity. Reconnection releases a _magnetic storm_, where one region becomes very bright a flare is emitted and 

Coronal mass ejection in the direction of the [Earth]() cause beautiful [aurorae](aurora) but also communication disruption. These particles travel to Earth three days so observing the Sun allows the satellite operators to shut affected satellites down in an orderly fashion in time for the event.
