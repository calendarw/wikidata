## Formation

According to models formed through [gravitational collapse of a gas cloud](solar system). Initially an opaque, radiating *photosphere* of size about 5AU and temperature 300K forms, then collapsed to twice the radius of the Sun and temperature rises to 4000K, while the luminosity of about 10 times current sun luminosity is maintained. That luminosity is fuelled by [Kelvin-Helmholtz processes]() and deuterium fusion. At this stage the Sun became a [pre-main sequence star](pre-main sequence stars). From this point it moved towards the [main sequence](main sequence stars), first by decreasing the luminosity, then, once the hydrogen fusion is ignited, by increasing temperature and finally decreasing luminosity again. This process took about 10 million years -- the amount of time that KH processes would provide the energy for.

## Death

After some 10 billion years there will be a large ball of helium in the centre of the core and the fusion will only be taking place in a shell around it. At the same time the rate of fusion will be much higher increasing the [luminosity]() and puffing up the envelope. At the peak the luminosity will reach over 2000 current sun luminosity and the radius will increase to 166 solar radia, completely subsuming [Mercury](). At the same time the sun will lose up to 28% of its mass due to weaker gravitational binding and increased solar wind. It will become a [red giant](), a cool, large and luminous star to the upper-right of the [main sequence](main sequence stars). This phase lasts some 600 million years.

When the rate of fusion can no longer be maintained the core will star to collapse. This collapse will cease due to [electron degeneracy]() pressure:

$P_e=K_e\rho^{5/3}$

$K_e\sim 3.2\times 10^6 \frac{Nm^{-2}}{(kg\ m^{-2})^{5/3}}$

Note that the pressure in degenerate core does not depend on the temperature. As the temperature exceeds 10^8 K [helium fusion]() ignites. This spreads rapidly through the helium core briefly increasing the luminosity hundreds thousands times. This [helium flash]() does not make it out of the star though, as the outer layers absorb the released energy. As a result the envelope contracts to about 10 current solar radia and luminosity decreases to about 41 current solar luminosities. [This phase](horizontal branch star) lasts few hundred million years. As a result the core will accumulate inert carbon and oxygen which will eventually collapse into degeneracy. The sun expands again, to about 180 current radia and the luminosity increases to 3000 the current value. Over the next 100 thousand years a series of pulses will take place: as the inert helium in a shell between helium and hydrogen fusion becomes degenerate and starts fusing, it expands the hydrogen fusing shell, decreasing the energy output of the fusion in there and contracting the star. That in turn increases the pressure and fusion rate. In this phase the peak radius reaches 213 current radia (reaching today's Earth orbit -- byt the time this happens Earth's orbit would have increased due to smaller mass of the sun) and luminosity 5200 times the current value. At the same time there is a rapid mass loss due to superwind. 

Eventually the outer layers are stripped and what is left is the extremely hot carbon-oxygen core, which will gradually cool down and become a [white dwarf](). UV radiation from the core will ionise the gas from ejected outer layers producing a beautiful [planetary nebula]().

## Structure

### Observing

Helioseismology: shifts in [spectra](spectroscopy) tell us how different regions fluctuate and move with respect to one another.

### Regions

#### Core

to 1/4 of the radius. Temperatures 15-16 million K. Density of Hydrogen: 150 times the density of water. Contains 40% of the mass of the Sun. It is in stable equilibrium, because when the rate of fusion decreases the core cools, contracts, the gravity increases and rate of fusion increases. *Luminosity is determined by how much they hydrogen is compressed, ie. the total mass of a star*.

#### Radiation Zone
 
between .25R  and .7 R. Consists of [plasma](). Temperature 2 million K. Energy transfer mode: radiation diffusion: gamma rays from core are absorbed and reemitted and reabsorbed and reemitted... it takes a photon 170 000 years to travel through this region.

#### Convection Zone (Photosphere)

Between .7 to 1R. Temperature decreases to 5700 K at the surface and density decreases from density of water to near zero. Plasma becomes opaque and the most efficient mode of heat transfer is through convection cells. That's why the surface appears granular. The cells have sizes of thousands of kilometers.

#### Chromosphere

h <= 2000 km. Temperature rises to 50 thousand K. Very tenuous and not visible.

#### Corona

h between 200 km and 1.3 R

Temperature of 2 million K. Best visible in UV and X-Ray. Source of the [solar wind]().

## Weather

Spots on the Sun are an indication. They are depressions in the surface. There is an 11 year cycle in variation of number of sunspots. The are regions of intense magnetic field that stops the convection. They are cooler than the rest of the surface, down to 4000 K. Where do they come from?

At the start of the cycle the magnetic field on the sun is orderly and polar. However, the equator rotates faster than the pole (Sun is fluid). As a result the magnetic field lines are stretched like rubber bands, form loops of charged particles, creates sun spots, it all becomes a mess, and after 11 years the polar magnetic field is reinstated with reversed polarity. Reconnection releases a _magnetic storm_, where one region becomes very bright a flare is emitted and 

Coronal mass ejection in the direction of the [Earth]() cause beautiful [aurorae](aurora) but also communication disruption. These particles travel to Earth three days so observing the Sun allows the satellite operators to shut affected satellites down in an orderly fashion in time for the event.
