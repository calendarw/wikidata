(Robert C. Martin) -- agile and OO coach, speaker, author ([Clean Code](), among others). While I often agree with the ideas he expresses, I have issues with the way he delivers them, which are nicely summarised by this quote from [notfancy's Reddit comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nn3an/dance_you_imps_uncle_bobs_hilarious_take_on_orms/cck5h95):

> I find it condescending. I find it patronizing. I find it divisive. I find it dogmatic. I find it absolutist. I find it abuses parable only for rhetorical effect. I find it typically Uncle Bob, in sum.
