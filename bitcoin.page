## Derivation

The below is a rephrasing of [Michael Nielsen's description](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/). We can arrive at Bitcoin by trying the following steps of development of cryptocurrency protocol:

### Letter of Intent

Alice broadcast a message saying "I'm giving X amount of bitcoin to Bob" and signs it with her private key. Everyone can verify that Alice indended to give Bob bitcoin and that it is not a forgery. However, Alice could send the same message N times and it would not be clear whether she intended to give Bob N*X bitcoin or if the message was just duplicated.

### Serial Numbers

To deal with that problem we introduce unique bitcoin numbers and a bank that assigns these. Everyone dealing in Bitcoin has an account with the bank and when Alice wants to pay Bob the bank reduces her balance and assigns unique numbers to withdrawn bitcoin. She then sends her message with the numbers included. Bob check with the bank that the bitcoin belongs to Alica and has not already been spent, and if so, accepts the transfer registering it with the bank that reassigns given numbers to Bob. The downside of this approach is that there is now a central institution that controls the supply and flow of the currency. (TODO: why is it bad?)

### Distributed Bank

The cetral bank can be done away with if everyone in the network kept track of who owns what bitcoin. Instead of checking with the bank Bob would then check his record and also broadcast a query to the network, and after enough responses came back confirming that the transaction is legitimate, accept the transfer. Checking with the network is required to prevent Alice from sending the same bitcoin to two different recipients at the same time in the hope they will accept before they become aware of the duplication of the transfer. However, another function of the central bank was assigning the unique numbers. Where do these come from in the distributed world? Furthermore, checking with the network still does not guarantee security: Alice could have taken over the network by setting up large number of nodes that will authorise all her double-spending.

### Proof of Work

The latter issue can be addressed by making issuing confirmation of transactions expensive. For example, we might require that whoever confirms transactions as genuine has to solve a hard computational problem. With enough participants in the network, this would make the takeover described prohibitively expensive. In Bitcoin a node (David) checks entire block of transactions. The block is labeled with a transaction label *l* -- a string of bytes. Once he verifies them as genuine he has to find a *nonce* (*n*; another string of bytes) such that the SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of *l* and *n* is smaller than a given number. This is calibrated so that this search takes 10 minutes on average. Once David finds the correct nonce he can broadcast to the network that the transactions are okay, and include the nonce in his message as the proof of work.

* someone threw away a harddisk with 7 million USD worth of bitcoin on it
* cashing out is difficult and the rates paid are nowhere near officially quoted exchange rates
