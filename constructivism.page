(or intuitionism)

Brouwer postulated that:

* mathematics is a human activity that is about communicating ideas, so we should focus on the language
* fundamental human faculty is the concept of an algorithm (for performing a construction)
* proofs are forms of construction

Consequence:

proof (not to be confused with formal proof!) is a mathematical object.

## Law of Excluded Middle

Hilbert was vehemently opposed to this approach. According to Robert Harper he was mistaken: he though Brouwer was negating all achievements of maths to date. Instead, he just didn't want ot affirm the [law of excluded middle](); so if something could be proven in his system, it would have been a stronger result than with LEM.

Why this particular assumption was denied? Because it prevents construction. TODO
