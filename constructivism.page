Brouver postulated that:

* mathematics is a human activity that is about communicating ideas, so we should focus on the language
* fundamental human faculty is the concept of an algorithm (for performing a construction)
* proofs are forms of construction

Consequence:

proof (not to be confused with formal proof!) is a mathematical object.
