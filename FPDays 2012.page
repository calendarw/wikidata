Scientist view: mathematical approach to development

Most people at Google would rather create a programming language that lets them solve a problem than solve a problem itself -- a very engineering approach.

## Pragmatism

* writing minimal readable code (not factory factories)
* using frameworks that fit the problem and are easy to hack on(not Spring everywhere, not Lift)
* don't try to solve solved problems, use libraries
* move fast and break stuff
* deployed code is more valuable than perfect code

(a bit like architect/hacker dichotomy)

## What functional pragmatism isn't?

* using type tehory to ensure fewer bugs
* using immutability to ensure easy concurrancy
* writing monadic code because it's conceptually elegant


## Scala is good for

* team building and morale
* hiring filter

## Best functional (Scala) bits for pragmatist

* readability, less boilerplate
* can code without nulls
* immutability
* collections
* processing sequences of data structure (map/filter/fold)


# Clojure

_Samuel Aaron_

* Music systems are complex, with realtime requirements
* Lisp -- timeless programming style: using data structures of the language to describe the language itself
* Clojure -- sets, vectors and maps have explicit syntax
* Clojure is designed to be hosted
* Design patterns in software are not what the architectural ones represented; they are about how to build, not "intention"; intention would be e.g. "modularity", "islation", "reduction of states".
* Software design patterns contribute to accidental complexity
* in Emacs paredit mode the editor works with code structore, not text: C-k deletes not to the end of the line, but to the enclosing parenthesis

## Atomic Data types

~~~ {.clojure}
(type "asdf")

(type \a)

(type (/ 1 3))

(type (+ 3N Long/MAX_VALUE))

(type true)
~~~

### Reader macros

~~~ {.clojure}
(type #"[ac]+")
~~~

~~~
text -> reader -------> data structures
            |                  ^ 
            |                  |
            +---> #"foo" -> program
~~~

### Symbols

variables:

~~~ {.clojure}
(def foo 1)
(+ foo 1)
~~~

### Keywords

~~~ {.clojure}
(type :foo)
:foo ;; constant for the entire system
~~~

## Aggregate Data Types

* List: `'(1 2 3 4 5)`
* Vector: `[1 2 3 4 5]`

Most data structures are represented as trees, which allows persistence and sharing.

* Map: `{:foo 1 : bar 3}`

~~~ {.clojure}
(get {:foo 1 : bar 3} : foo "not found")
~~~

functions like `first` and `rest` work on all of them.

* Set: `#{1 2 3 4}`

## Functions

~~~ {.clojure}
(defn foo [a] (+ a 2))
~~~

## JVM interop

~~~ {.clojure}
Math/PI

(.toUpperCase "foo")
~~~


Emacs setup:
github/overtone/emacs-live
nRepl
paredit
accomplete gives autocompletion

Use [clojure cheat sheets](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) -- once you memorise them, you're a fantastic clojure programmer

## Namespaces

~~~ {.clojure}
(ns intro.core) ;; works for entire file
(def x "hello")
~~~

~~~
symbol (x) -> var -> value ("hello")
~~~

we can write 

~~~ {.clojure}
(var foo "sam")
(deref (var foo))
~~~

# Machine Learning and F#

_Andrew Gordon, Microsoft_

* Infer.Net -- not yet available for commercial use, research project
* Bayesian statistics as unifying principle
* lots of libraries for classification, regression etc -- but a lot of problemms don't fit into this abstraction, e.g. matching players with similar abilities given history of matches

## Murder Mystery

Alice murdered with prob 30%, Bob 90%. Alice uses gun 3% of time and pipe 97%

~~~ {.fsharp}
let mystery () =
  let aliceDunnit = random (Bernoulli 0.30)
  let withGun =
    if aliceDunnit
    then random (Bernoulli 0.03)
    else random (Bernoulli 0.80)
  aliceDUnnit, withGun
~~~

This is a subset of F# called "fun".

Now, we found pipe at the scene:

~~~ {.fsharp}
let piepFoundAtScene () =
  let aliceDunnit, withGun = mystery ()
  observe(withGun = false)
  aliceDunnit, withGun
~~~

## Graphical Models

by rejection sampling, we only leave the samples that match observations. This is typically very inefficient. Infer.Net uses techniques pioneered by Judea Pearl and his graphical models.

* Bayes Networks (Pearl 1988)
* going from observed to unobserved data
* graphical notations capture dependence

Uses in Microsoft:

* TrueSkill -- player skill matching
* AdSelect -- how likely users are to click on an add

## Infer.Net

since 2006

* .Net library for probabilistic inference, with multiple algorithms, for large scale inference
* representing model as code is natural for language geeks who are not necessarily expert on stats!
* Infer.Net Fun allows writing models in F#
* Runs forwards to synthesise data or backwards to infer parameters

## Linear Regression

(trying to find a linear function that best fits data points)

~~~ {.fsharp}
let prior () =
  let a = random(Gaussian(0.0, 1.0))
  let b = random(Gaussian(5.0, 0.3))
  let noise = random(Gamma(1.0, 1.0))
  a, b, noise

let point x a b noise =
  random(Gaussian(a* x + b, noise))

let model data =
  let a, b, noise = prior() 
  observe (data =
    [| for x,_ in data ->. point x a b noise |])
  // data is actual data
  a, b, noise

// gives us distributions
let aD, bD, noiseD = inferFun3 <@ model @> data
~~~

* `random` and `observe` are the main language contributions

## Demo

* 2-means clustering


## Q&A

* Research result: only one observe is required (and can be elided!)
* Result of function is always a distribution

## Performance

* Erlang is not meant for number crunching  build y
* in FP: supercompilation, e.g. list fusion (one f produces a list, another consumes, list gets eliminated) -- this is only tractable in FP

* The goal of strong typing effort is to ensure that the set of programs accepted by the compiler conincides with the set of programs we want to write

# Running a consultancy business

_Francesco Cesarini_

* don't name a company after yourself -- clients will want you personally to work
* don't name a company after services it provides -- you might want to exapand or change!
* don't name a company after a programming language
* have a number of clients, don't put all eggs in one basket; even better: no client should account for more than 50% of turnover
* business plans are not normally followed, but they are still worth doing, because they force us to think, do cash flow analysis
* cash flow analysis is critical -- if the revenue line shifts to the right, the area in red (between expenses and revenue line) becomes larger than green
* loans and overdrafts are needed in bad times, but they might be difficult to secure
* you need to be passionate about what you're doing
* pick your business partner with care -- it's like marriage; clearly define responsibilities and pick someone who complements your skill set
* employees are the most important asset; they need to understand and share the vision of the company (talking of which, the company should have a vision, which ties back to the passion)
* company changes a lot as it grows (and, presumably, as it contracts); you have to explain to employees that the change is for the better
* at certain size and number of customers you have to start modeling the cashflow and utilisation, not rely on gut feeling
* transition from services to product company is very hard; best spin-off products into separate companies
* relationship with customer is not just about getting them to pay; both of you need to realise you are in it together and help each other
* exit strategy: if you want to be acquired, don't worry about profitability, just grow as quickly as possible
* at certain size you need dedicated salespeople

# Live Programming

_Sam Aaron_

* Artists try to find new abstractions, new approaches to talking about things
* read "The Timeless Way of Building" by Christopher Alexader
* best chess player in the world: human + computer (Kasparov's "advanced chess"); even further: weak human + strong software beats strong human + weak software
* Emacs live FTW
* Overtone: writing DSL for music is incredibly difficult
* customise your tools to suit you, helps flow

## Overtone Demo

* samples from freesound
* grid controller for drum loop
* everything programmed in a couple dozen lines of Clojure

# Leiningen 2

* uses .m2 as local cache
* pallet for deployment tasks

# Clojure at uSwitch

* started from .Net stack
* confounded storage and processing of data; because of cost it was impossible to store data in raw form, it had to be continuously aggregated and processed. History was lost.
* Storing all data (domain-specific, personal, log) in uniform way allows to run interesting analysis, like predictions of what the users want to see
* Kafka for intermediate persistence (100 GB), then HDFS
* Esper for real-time processing
* Storm might be interesting, but haven't had need for it

# Functional DSLs for biocomputation

* applications to medicine (e.g. targeted cancer treatment based on understanding how cells work)
* http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dna/
* http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/gec/
* Microsoft Research employs biologists
* Parser combinators and active patterns (F#) nicer than traditional lexer/parser

# Concurrent Haskell

## Primitives

* Parallelism vs concurrency
* `forkIO` to fork a thread
* `GHC.Conc.threadStatus` is useful for debugging
* `MVar` -- basic communication primitive
* GHC runtime detects deadlocks ("thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation")
* `killThread` kills a thread (surprise, surprise)
* `+RTS -s -K32m` will print out runtime stats
* thread creation takes 1 microsecond (very cheap)
* for large number of threads (e.g. 1m) it makes a large difference whether threads can run immediately and be GCd, or if they block on MVar

## Example: overlapping IO

e.g. downloading multiple web pages simultaneously

~~~ {.haskell}
getURL :: String -> IO String

do
  m1 <- newEmptyMVar
  m2 <- newEmptyMVar

  forkIO $ getURL "http://1" >>= putMVar m1
  forkIO $ getURL "http://2" >>= putMVar m2
  
  r1 <- getMVar m1
  r2 <- getMVar m2

  return (r1, r2)
~~~

can we abstract out this pattern?

~~~ {.haskell} 
newtype Async a = ASync (Var a)

async :: IO a -> IO (Async a)
asyyc io = do
  m <- newEmptyMVar
  forkIO $  io >>= putMVar m
  return (ASync m)

wait :: Async a -> a
-- ...
~~~

Now we can map over asyncs.

## Stopping threads

~~~ {.haskell}
logger (Logger m) = forever $ do
  cmd <- takeMVar m
  case cmd of
    Message msg -> do
      putStrLn msg
    Stop s -> do
      putMVar s ()

logStop m = do
  s <- newEmptyMVar
  putMVar m $ Stop s
  getMVar s
  return ()
~~~

## Channels

* MVars are 1-place queues so can cause contention
* Chans are two MVars: one points to the head (for reading), the other to the last element (for writing). They can be mutated independently, so are good for concurrency

## Cancellation

~~~ {.haskell}
throwTo :: Exception e -> ThreadId -> e -> IO ()

cancel (Async t _) = throwTo t ThreadKilled
~~~

There are ways to protect critical sections (`Control.Exception`).

## Linking processes together

In Erlang we have a way of collapsing entire tree of processes if one fails. There is a Haskell pattern that can be used for it

~~~ {.haskell}
withAsync :: IO a -> (Async a -> IO b) -> IO b

do
  withAsync (getURL "....") $ \a1 -> do
  withAsync (getURL "...")  $ \a2 -> do
  r1 <- wait a1
  r2 <- wait a2
  return (a1, a2)
~~~

`withAsync` can be implemented using `bracket`

~~~ {.haskell}
bracket :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> (a -> IO c) -> IO c

withAsync io f = bracket (async io) cancel f
~~~
