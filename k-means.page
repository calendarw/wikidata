Clustering algorithm that requires upfront knowledge of the number of clusters we are looking for (that's the *k*).

Start by selecting *k* "cluster centres" at random. Then repeat:

* for each point in the set assign it to the cluster whose centre is the closest
* update the centres to be the average positions of all points in each cluster

until the movement af all centres falls below specified threshold.
