Sets of samples. On Linux can be used for playing MIDI via FluidSynth -- I use QSynth UI.

Ones I tried (in order of preference):

* Fluid R3
* Evanessence 2
* SGM-V2.01
* Unison

## Compressed Formats

For some reason people liked to use custom compressed formats to distribute sf2 files. Two I encountered were *sfArk* and *sfpack*. Both require windows UI apps to convert to sf2 -- in July 2013 these were easily found using Google, although they were hosted by third parties. Both can be run under Wine.
