Cheap food and wine!

### Espinho

Nice restuarant: Avenida 8. Non-smoking area is upstairs. Bill for two with wine ~40 Euro.

Large market on Mondays between Rua 22/24 and 29/31.

### Porto

TODO

### Coimbra

Underground parking near train station. Nice, narrow streets, University at the hilltop, "new cathedral". Food in "sandwich bar" between cathedral and university not very nice, might be better in a restuarant in umbrella alley close by.

### Bussaco

Lovely palace and a park on a hill. Probably aronud an hour's climb to the top, didn't manage this time round.
