Change in wave length of radiation emitted by objects that move away from us, caused by Doppler effect. Calculation of redshift:

* measure the spectrum of observed object
* compare measured spectrum (intensity of various frequencies of radiation) with signatures of known elements -- various elements cause characteristic patterns due to emission or absorption of certain ranges of frequencies
* the shifting of absorption/emission lines shows how much the frequencies have lengthened
