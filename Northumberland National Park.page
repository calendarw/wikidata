### The Plan

Day 0 (Friday the 3rd): leave in the evening from London King's Cross to Newcastle. Arrive in less than 4 hours, stay overnight.

Day 1 (Saturday the 4th): take a train to Bardon Mill, then go north, crossing Hadrian's Wall and into Wark Forest. Walk for a day and sleep somewhere around Kielder Water. Google shows a lot of rivers in Wark Forest, might not be passable in straight line.

Day 2 (Sunday the 5th): walk further north, perhaps on Penine Way, across A68, sleep somewhere up there.

Day 3 (Monday the 6th): need to get back to either Byrness or Rochester, to catch the bus back to Newcastle (there is only **one bus per day**, at 12:20 in Byrness, 12:28 in Rochester). In Newcastle take train back to London, arrive in the evening.
