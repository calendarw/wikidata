In statistics, a coefficient that denotes the level of correlation between two variables, symbolised by $r$. Ranges from -1 (perfect inverse correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation). Used for measuring correlation between two contiguous variables.

## Formula

$r = \frac{SP_{xy}}{\sqrt{SS_x\times SS_y}}$

Where:

$SP_{xy} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - M_x)\times (y_i - M_y)$

$SS_x = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - M_x)^2$

$M_x =$ mean of $x$
