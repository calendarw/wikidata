## Issues

* Dec 2012: first two weeks after purchase: engine management light went on, but then went off on its own.
* Jan 2013: the brake pads stuck to the disks -- that was after it had been parked for a couple of days after being driven in snow -- and the car wasn't moving despite being in gear. I had to rev up the engine quite a bit before it moved.
* Feb 2013: de-misting of rear window doesn't work very well.
* Feb 2013: front right wheel was not holding pressure. Took it to National, they cleaned the seal on the alloy and it seems a bit better. I've been told that can happen with alloys if the car is not used very often.

## Playing mp3

Playing mp3 files from SD card requires a PCMCIA adapter. I tried a random one bought from Maplin, but it was not recognised at all. Finally decided to buy an (expensive) Mercedes-branded one on EBay. That worked, but the playback skipped in a very annoying way, and sometimes just stopped and reset to the first track on the SD card. It turned out that the player doesn't cope with the 320 kbps bitrate I had been ripping to. After reducing the bitrate to ~256 kbps (variable) it seems to be playing mostly fine -- skips are infrequent. I suspect it would be completely fine at 192 kbps, but I'd rather not reduce the quality further, because I listen to the same mp3 files at work, on good equipment.
