We want to fit a ladder of length L in a garage of length GL. If we take the ladder and run very fast into garage the ladder will [contract](length contraction) to $L\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, so for high enough $v$ will fit in the garage. Now, imagine that someone is sitting on the ladder as we run with it. In the frame of this observer the garage is moving and contracting. So will the ladder fit, or not?

To answer this, we need to ask: what happens first, $x_1$ or $x_2$? Let's see:

------------------------------------  ------------------------------------
$x'= \frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$   $t'= \frac{t-vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$
$x= \frac{x'+vt'}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$  $t= \frac{t'+vx'/c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$
------------------------------------  ------------------------------------

If we take $x_2=G$ and $x_2'=L$ (the description of $x_2$ in two frames) and plug that to the equation for $x'$, we'll get $vt_2=G-L\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. As we have chosen sufficiently large $v$, we know that this is $>0$; i.e. the ladder is inside for $0\le t\le t_2$. On the other hand plugging these into equation for $x$ gives us negative $vt_2'$.

However:

$c^2t^2-x^2=c^2t'^2-x'^2$ i.e. the scales of the x,t and x',t' axes are different; primes have larger scales, because invariant intervals are hyperbolic.

TODO: picture

What if we close the door at the right? The right end will stop, but the left end will continue to travel until the information that the right end stopped reaches it (and it can propagate at most with speed $c$).

Lesson: thinking of object as having definite length in relativistic sense is a bad idea.
