Very little mass, only weakly interacting. Discovered as missing energy in [neutron decay](nuclear decay):

$n \rightarrow p + e + \bar{\nu}_e$

There are three types: electron, muon and tau neutrinos. They spontanously oscillate between these types.

## Detection

First detector: Chlorine tank in gold mine. Very rarely a neutrino will hit a neutron and trigger a decay into proton and electron. As a result the chlorine should decay into argon. Every couple of months there should be a dozen or so argon atoms. It turned out there were fewer, and that's because this reaction is only triggered by electron neutrinos. Only electron neutrinos are [produced in the Sun](pp process), but by the time they reach Earth two thirds will have oscillated into other types. This led to discovery of other types of neutrinos.

The efforts as of 2014 involve Ice Cube neutrino observatory in the south pole. Some other detectors use lead, which has to be very pure; for that purpose physicists buy lead recovered from ship wrecks that have spent centuries underwater (e.g. ones from the Roman times).
