## Testing

To test for "normality" in R:

~~~ {.r}
> data <- read.table(path)
> library(psych)
> describe(data)

        var  n  mean    sd median trimmed   mad  min   max range skew kurtosis
PID       1 42 21.50 12.27  21.50   21.50 15.57 1.00 42.00 41.00 0.00    -1.29
Prime     2 42  1.50  0.51   1.50    1.50  0.74 1.00  2.00  1.00 0.00    -2.05
Haste     3 42  2.00  0.83   2.00    2.00  1.48 1.00  3.00  2.00 0.00    -1.57
Helping   4 42  1.87  1.29   1.78    1.78  1.31 0.04  4.66  4.62 0.43    -0.79
          se
PID     1.89
Prime   0.08
Haste   0.13
Helping 0.20
~~~

Rule of thumb: if skew is greater than 3 or (absolute?) kurtosis is greater than 10 then the distribution is not normal.

## Achieving

Most basic statistical methods ([correlation](inter-item correlation) measurement, [linear regression](), [t-test]()) assume normal distribution of the outcome variable. There are ways to massage the data if it's not normally distributed so that it fits the assumption:

For positive skew:

* square root
* logarithm
* inverse ($\frac{1}{x}$)

For negative skew: take the opposite, then deal with positive skew.

While these transformations change the variance and distance between cases they maintain the relative order of cases.
