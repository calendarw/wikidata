## First Law

Objects move with constant [velocity]() unless a force is applied to them.

## Second Law

The magnitued of acceleration is proportional to the applied force and its direction is the same as of that of the force.

## Third Law

Whenever a $A$ applies force $F$ to $B$, $B$ reacts with a force of the same magnitude but opposite direction onto $A$.
