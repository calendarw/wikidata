Not to be confused with [general linear model](), which is less general! Generalised model is an extension that allows for non-normal distributions in the outcome variable. Often we can achieve [normal distribution]() by transformation of variables, but sometimes it is not feasible. Generalised model to the rescue!

## Link Function

Generalised model differs from the general model by introduction of link function. E.g. in [binary logistic regression]():

$ln\frac{Y}{1-Y}=B_0+\sum B_kX_k$

the term to the left of the equals sign is the link function. Instead of $Y$ we use some function of $Y$ -- in this case the logistic function.
