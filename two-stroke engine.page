* Some two-stroke engines depended on fuel-oil mixture for lubrication, so engine-breaking (when driven shaft spins faster than drive shaft and moves the pistons without fuel being delivered to the cylinders) could destroy the engine. For this reason a freewheel was sometimes used to prevent engine breaking, e.g. in some Saab models and in Wartburg.
