An object consisting of ice and dust. Most originate in [Kuiper belt](). Can have tenuous dusty atmosphere -- *coma* -- which can be size of the Sun (!). This atmosphere is produced by jets that occure where the comet is heated by the Sun.

They have two tails, dusty tail and ion (gas) tail. The dusty one drags behind the comet slightly along the orbit while the gas one is radial from the Sun. The tails can be over 2 AU long (!).
