An object consisting of ice and dust. Most originate in [Kuiper belt](). Can have tenuous dusty atmosphere -- *coma* -- which can be size of the Sun (!). This atmosphere is produced by jets that occure where the comet is heated by the Sun.

They have two tails:

* dusty tail; drags behind the comet slightly along the orbit, reflects light
* ion (gas) tail; is straight along the line from from the Sun, glows blue

The tails can be over 2 AU long (!).

Orbits of the comets are full of orbiting space junk. If Earth encounters such orbit (happens once a year) we experience a [meteor shower]().
