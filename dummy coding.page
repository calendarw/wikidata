In [statistics](), a way to code categorical variables so that they can be plugged into [multiple regression](linear regression). 

Note: this is only useful if we have some categorical and some continuous predictors. If all predictors are categorical then a better model is a one-way [ANOVA]().

## Example

We want to predict number of publications from group professor is in. There are four groups: Cognitive, Clinical, Developmental, Social. We choose a reference group, say, Cognitive, then create one additional dummy variable for each other group:

------------- -- -- --
group         D1 D2 D3
------------- -- -- --
Cognitive      0  0  0

Clinical       1  0  0

Developmental  0  1  0

Social         0  0  1
------------- -- -- --

Now we can use D1, D2 and D3 in multiple regression:

$Y = B0 + B_1D_1 + B_2D_2 + B_3D_3 + e$

Note: the results will be with Cognitive as a reference. If we want the reference to be the average for all groups then we can use [effects coding]().
