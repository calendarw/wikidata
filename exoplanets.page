1-40% of sun-like stars have planets. Most of the planets detected to date are within 300 light-years from Earth.

## Detection

The most effective methods (see below) are most sensitive to "hot Jupiters" -- large planets that orbit close to their star.

### Imaging

36/900 planets found this way.

### Astrometry

The planet and the star orbit common centre of mass:

$R_s = (M_p/M)R$

Only one planet found with this method. It's difficult to observe small movements of distant stars.

### Radial Velocity Measurements

If the planet orbits in such a plane that the velocity vector is directed from/away from earth then thanks to [Doppler effect]() the [spectrum](spectroscopy) of the star will change as it orbits the common centre of mass.

$v_s^2=\frac{GM_pR_s}{R^2}$

and from $R_s = (M_p/M)R$ we get

$v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\times\frac{M_p}{M}$

Weavelengths can be measured with great accuracy; most of the plantes have been found this way.

### Transiting

The star dims periodically as the planet orbits it. Again, depends on the orbiting plane being aligned in a convenient way.

Kepler space telescope has 2321 candidate planets in 1290 systems.

Transit method is not considered a "complete" detecion, needs to be verified by other means.

### Gravitational Lensing

16 planets in 15 systems.

### Transit Timing Variation

Allows prediction of other planets in a system where a planet is found based on discrepancies in transit times.
