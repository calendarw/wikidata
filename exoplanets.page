## Detection

### Imaging

36/900 planets found this way.

### Astrometry

The planet and the star orbit common centre of mass:

$R_s = (M_p/M)R$

Only one planet found with this method. It's difficult to observe small movements of distant stars.

### Spectroscopy

If the planet orbits in such a plane that the velocity vector is directed from/away from earth then thanks to [Doppler effect]() the spectrum of the star will change as it orbits the common centre of mass.

$v_s^2=\frac{GM_pR_s}{R^2}$

and from $R_s = (M_p/M)R$ we get

$v_s = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}\times\frac{M_p}{M}$
