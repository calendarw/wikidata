### Parties

* Mobile App -- app that receives notifications
* APNs -- a server controlled by Apple (`gateway.push.apple.com`) that delivers notifications to devices
* Notification Provider -- an application that sends notifications to instances of Mobile App

### Device Token

Token used by the notification provider is requested by Mobile App, generated by APNs and then passed by Mobile App on to the Notification Provider. Notification Provider must use it whenever it wants to notify that particular instance of Mobile App.
