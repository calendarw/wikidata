While the coordinates on the [celestial sphere]() describe positions of stars relative to each other, to describe what we see at any given moment we use the local view coordinates. These are: 

* altitude: the angle from the horizon (zenith is at 90 degrees) -- corresponds to latitude on Earth
* azimuth: the angle from the *prime meridian*, which is a line going from throught the zenith and north and south poles of the celestial sphere (East is 90 degrees, West 270 degrees) -- corresponds to longitude on Earth.
