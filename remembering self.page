The part of conciousness that remembers experiences (cf. [experiencing self]()). [Daniel Kahneman]() gave a good example of "the tyranny of memory": an experience of listening to a beautiful recording can be spoiled by a scratch towards the end, and we will remember it badly. In general, our evaluation of experiences is mostly based on what it was like towards the end (the [peak-end rule]()).
