## The Truth Scheme

*'A' is true iff A*

## Tarski's Definition

For a given [formal language]() *L* the definition of truth follows the rules of grammar. E.g.:

* $x \in \{Socrates, Tarski\}$
(1) '*x* is a philosopher' is a sentence of *L*
(2) if both *a* and *b* are sentences of *L* then '*a* and *b*' is a sentence of *L* 

Then for rule (1) we can define the truth as:

* 'Socrates is a philosopher' is true iff Socrates is a philosopher
* 'Tarski is a philosopher' is true iff Tarski is a philosopher

And for rule (2):

* '*a* and *b*' is true iff a is true and b is true
