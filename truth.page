## The Truth Scheme

*'A' is true iff A*

## Tarski's Definition

For a given [formal language]() *L* the definition of truth follows the rules of grammar. E.g.:

* $x \in \{Socrates, Tarski\}$
(1) '*x* is a philosopher' is a sentence of *L*
(2) if both *a* and *b* are sentences of *L* then '*a* and *b*' is a sentence of *L* 

Then for rule (1) we can define the truth as:

* 'Socrates is a philosopher' is true iff Socrates is a philosopher
* 'Tarski is a philosopher' is true iff Tarski is a philosopher

And for rule (2):

* '*a* and *b*' is true iff a is true and b is true

This definition exploits the recursive structure of *L*: the semantic rules follow syntactic rules. It is argued that such recursiveness is present in natural languages and is essential to us being able to understand the meaning of sentences we have never encountered before.
