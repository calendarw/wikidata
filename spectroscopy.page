The lines that can be observed in the spectrum when white light shines through a cloud of atoms can reveal the internal structure of those atoms. This is because it tells us which frequencies a given atom can interact with and that interaction is determined by the layout of electrons.

Each photon carries a quantum of energy related to the frequency of light it represents:

$E=hf$

When photons "hit" electrons the transferred energy moves the electron to a higher energy level. The possible energy levels of electrons are discrete:

$E_n=\frac{-K}{n^2}$

So the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the difference in energy between the two levels:

$hf=E_n-E_m$
