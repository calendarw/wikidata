The lines that can be observed in the spectrum when white light shines through a cloud of atoms can reveal the internal structure of those atoms. This is because it tells us which frequencies a given atom can interact with and that interaction is determined by the layout of electrons.

Each photon carries a quantum of energy related to the frequency of light it represents:

$E=hf$

When photons "hit" electrons the transferred energy moves the electron to a higher energy level. The possible energy levels of electrons are discrete:

$E_n=\frac{-K}{n^2}$

The absorbed wave lenghts can be associated with the difference in energy levels:

$\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H\left(\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{m^2}\right)$

Where $R_H$ is the [Rydberg constant]().

**TODO**: the below formula [turned out to be wrong](https://class.coursera.org/introastro-002/forum/thread?thread_id=589). Why? Equating the energy seems to make sense.

> So the energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to the difference in energy between the two levels:
> 
> $hf=E_n-E_m$
