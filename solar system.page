## Formation

Current prevailing theory is that some 4.55-4.58 billion years ago (age obtained through [radiometric dating]()) a large cloud of gas fragmented and a [gravitational collapse](Jeans instability) started within it -- probably as a result of an explosion of a [supernova](), or a number of supernovae. One fragment of the cloud, of size between 2,000 and 20,000 AU and mass of 3,000 solar masses separated and that's where a cluster of 1,000-10,000 stars formed. One of those stars was the Sun. Nowadays this cluster no longer exists -- Sun is not gravitationally bound to any other star -- and search for members of the cluster has not brought any results so far.

When a (roughly spherical) and rotating cloud of gas collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes it to spin faster and flatten into a disc -- *protoplanetary disc*. That's why the orbits of all planets in the solar system are approximately in the same plane and the planets orbit in the same direction.

In the protoplanetary disc the density and temperature is highest at the center and gradually falls towards the edge. The central region whose boundary is around 2000K is the *protosun*. In about 10 million years the star ignites and starts producing *T-Tauri wind* that blows away all remaining gas and dust from the disc. Anything that has not formed before then is removed by this extremely strong stream of particles.

## Mass

Sun accounts for 99.9% of the mass of the solar system.
