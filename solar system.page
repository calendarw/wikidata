## Formation

Current prevailing theory is that some 4.55-4.58 billion years ago (age obtained through [radiometric dating]()) a large cloud of gas fragmented and a [gravitational collapse](Jeans instability) started within it -- probably as a result of an explosion of a [supernova](), or a number of supernovae. One fragment of the cloud, of size between 2,000 and 20,000 AU and mass of 3,000 solar masses separated and that's where a cluster of 1,000-10,000 stars formed. One of those stars was the Sun. Nowadays this cluster no longer exists -- Sun is not gravitationally bound to any other star -- and search for members of the cluster has not brought any results so far.

When a (roughly spherical) and rotating cloud of gas collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes it to spin faster and flatten into a disc -- *protoplanetary disc*. That's why the orbits of all planets in the solar system are approximately in the same plane and the planets orbit in the same direction. In the protoplanetary disc the density and temperature is highest at the center and gradually falls towards the edge. The central region whose boundary is around 2000K is the *protosun*. In about 10 million years the star ignites and starts producing *T-Tauri wind* that blows away all remaining gas and dust from the disc. Anything that has not formed before then is removed by this extremely strong stream of particles. 

The planet formation occurs differently depending on the distance from the star, specifically the "snow line" -- 170K, where water transforms from solid to vapour is the boundary between two substantially different regions.

### Inner Planets

Within the snow line, in the disc rocks form by molecules of metals first sticking together electrostatically and then binding chemically. Once rocks exceed 1 km in size they become *planetesimals* -- bodies that are stronger bound gravitationally than chemically. Billions of these form and start orbiting in [Keplerian](Johannes Kepler) orbits and hundreds of them eventually form *protoplanets* -- objects of radius around 1,000 km. Once an object reaches this size, the heat of the collisions and Kelvin-Helmholz heating heats it so much that it melts and naturally forms a symmetric, spherical shape. Due to spinning it's slightly fatter at the equator. Another thing that happens is chemical differentiation, where the heavier elements (iron, nickel etc.) sink to the centre and the lighter (silicates) stay on top. At this stage the chemical bonds no longer protect the body from collapse; instead, hydrostatic pressure ensures it maintains its size and shape.

The protoplanets orbit the star, clearing out lanes in the dust cloud. Due to gravitational interactions between them the orbits are perturbed and collisions occur. These are usually devastating for the participants, but occassionally the colliding protoplanets re-melt and merge into a larger object. Eventually, all smaller objects are either accreted by larger ones or ejected from the system and in the period between 10 and 100 million years from the start of the process the orbits stabilise as near-circular due to friction.

### Outer Planets

In the outer solar system water is a solid, and it's an overall prevalent substance in the solar system. The formation of planetesimals is much faster than in the inner system. They grow to much larger sizes as well, and at the mass of around 10 Earth masses they become capable of capturing an atmosphere of $H_2$ and $He$. As these elements constitute 98% of the mass of the cloud, this allows these planets to become giants. These form accretion discs, not unlike the protostar -- the leftovers of these will form moons and rings. Eventually all of the gas in the orbits of these giants is captured by them and there is nothing for the T-Tauri wind to blow off. This is how Jupiter and Saturn formed.

Uranus and Neptune likely formed later when there was not much gas to be captured, hence they are large, but not gas giants. However, at the distance they are at there is not enough material for them to grow to their present size at the time they are estimated to have formed, so the current theory (Nice model) is that they formed closer to the sun and then migrated away due to [orbital resonance]() with Jupiter and Saturn. These two at some point became locked in 2:1 period and pulled Uranus and Neptune out. These cleared all of the debris on their way out, pushing all remaining planetesimals to trans-Neptunian orbits and further, to the Kuiper belt and even out of the ecliptic, to Oort cloud. All this movement and collisions caused some asteroids to slow down and fall towards the inner solar system, resulting in what is known as time of *heavy bombardment*, around 600 million years since the start. At the same time the orbits of the outer planets stabilise in a similar fashion to these of the inner planets.

After abou 700 million years the system is in a stable configuration and first life can start on Earth.
