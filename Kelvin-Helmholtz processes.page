The processes occuring inside planets that heat them up. Relies on conversion of [gravitational energy](gravity) to heat. Proposed by lord Kelvin as a solution to the problem that (in)efficiency of chemical burning of hydrogen in the [Sun]() would mean that it would run out of fuel in 10 thousand years. Kelvin-Helmholtz process would provide energy for 10 million years, which was better, but still too short. It was later properly explained by [strong nuclear force](strong interaction).
