Two twins live until certain age together on Earth. Then one of them jumps onto a spaceship that travels with relativistic speed in some direction. After certain time the ship turns back and travels with the same speed back to Earth. When the twins are reunited, are they of the same age?

$c^2T_1^2-x_1^2=c^2T_1'^2-x_1'^2$

$2T_1 = \frac{2T_1'}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$

$T_2=T_1'\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$

## Solution

At point $1$ the travelling twin experienced acceleration. At that point line of simultaneity changed so that while initially $1$ was simultaneous with $2$ at the time of change of direction it became simultaneous with $3$; i.e. in this instant stationary twin aged the time difference between $3$ and $2$. The acceleration explains why there is no symmetry and the twin on Earth aged more.

What happens if we (realistically) take the accelleration to not be infinite? We can imagine that the traveller approaches a massive star at hyperbolic trajectory and gets ejected back to Earth. The traveller's clock will run slower in gravitational field of the star due to gravitational red shift.
