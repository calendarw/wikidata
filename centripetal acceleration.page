Acceleration of a body that moves with constant speed along a circle. As such, its [velocity]() $v$ constantly changes; this change is described by acceleration $a$. The direction of $a$ is always from the body towards the cetre of the circle and the magnitude is $a=\frac{v^2}{R}$, where $R$ is the radius of the circle.
