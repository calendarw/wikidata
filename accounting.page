## Accounts

Four types of accounts:

* _asset_
* _liability_
* _income_
* _expense_

Two types of actions on a given account

* _debit_
* _credit_

For every accounting operation the sum of debits must be equal to the sum of credits. Going forward we will write

~~~ {.asciiart}
Account name
-----+------
100  |
     | 200
~~~

With debits on the left side and credits on the right side.

## Example

1. I get a loan of £2000 from Andrew
2. I buy a van for £500
3. I buy flowers for £500 and have them delivered to me for £100
4. I sell flowers for £750 with payment at the end of the month
5. I receive the payment
