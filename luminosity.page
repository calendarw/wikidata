## Of the Sun

We can measure the *brightness* of the Sun on earth by measuring how much it heats up 1 $m^2$ of dark material. It turns out to be $b = 1361 \frac{W}{m^2}$ (i.e. can power a small hair dryer). We can then calculate the luminosity:

$L = 4\pi D^2b$

Where $D$ is the distance from Earth to Sun.
