## Of a Star

$L=4\pi R^2b$

$b$ is apparent brightness ([flux](black-body radiation)) so if we know the temperature at the surface of the star we can calculate $b=\sigma T^4$ and take $R$ to be the radius of the star.

## Of a Planet

If a planet of radius $R$ and [albedo]() $a$ is at distance $D$ from a star with luminosity $L_S$:

$L_P=\frac{aL_S}{4}\left(\frac{R}{D}\right)^2$

This formula can be derived by calculating the amount of radiation received by each $m^2$ of a sphere at distance $D$ and multiplying it by by cross section ($2\pi R$) of the planet.

## Of the Sun

We can measure the *brightness* of the Sun on earth by measuring how much it heats up 1 $m^2$ of dark material. It turns out to be $b = 1361 \frac{W}{m^2}$ (i.e. can power a small hair dryer). We can then calculate the luminosity:

$L = 4\pi D^2b$

Where $D$ is the distance from Earth to Sun.
