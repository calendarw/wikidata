## Calculation

We can measure the *brightness* of the Sun on earth by measuring how much it heats up 1 $m^2$ of dark material. It turns out to be $b = 1361 \frac{W}{m^2}$ (i.e. can power a small hair dryer). We can then calculate the *luminosity*:

$L = 4\pi D^2b$

Where $D$ is the distance from Earth to Sun. This turns out to be $3.83\times 10^{26} W$

*Flux* is luminosity divided by surface area, i.e $F=\frac{4\pi D^2b}{4\pi R^2}=b\left(\frac{D}{R}\right)^2=6.29\times 10^7 \frac{W}{m^2}$

From [Stefan-Boltzmann relation](https://notepad.mmakowski.com/black-body%20radiation#stefan-boltzmann-relation) we have $T=\left(\frac{F}{\sigma}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}=5770K$
