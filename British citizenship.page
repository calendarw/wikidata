## 9 March 2013

Browsed a [Home Office web pages](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/applicationtypes/naturalisation/), registered for [*Life in the UK* test](http://lifeintheuktest.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/) (for the 29th of April) and ordered [study materials](http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1278111&ProductID=9780113413614&Action=Book&CLICKID=002289). It appears that the only step required after passing the test is submitting the form and [accompanying documents](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/applicationtypes/naturalisation/supportingdocuments/). The only potential issue seems to be "alternative proof of residency" for those who don't have their passports stamped at the border.
