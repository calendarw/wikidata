## Sessions and results

### 1st August 2013

-----------  --------------------
Where        Raceway Docklands
Started      4th of 12
Finished     3th of 11
Fastest Lap  0:43.66
-----------  --------------------

Uneventful race, the only overtake was when the guy in front spun, other than that just lapping. Very few karts on the circuit, so most of the time it felt like driving on an empty track. Kart 8.

#### Observations

* The power output at low revs is very low, so it takes a while for the kart to start accellerating. This means full throttle can be applied earlier in the bend as its effect will only be felt after a couple of seconds.
* With very few karts on the circuit wide lines are fine.

-----------  --------------------

Palms of my hands ached terribly after the race, I must have had them very tense throughout. Most of the times when I was overtaken it was when I approached the corner on a wide line and left enough space inside for someone to sneak through.

#### Observations

Corner approach should depend on whether someone is right behind. If so, the line should be tight to not leave any room to overtake on the inside; otherwise wide to not require as much breaking.
