## Sessions and results

### 9th September 2013

-----------  --------------------
Where        Raceway Docklands
Started      10th? of 20
Finished     11th of 20
Fastest Lap  0:44.73
Others       Wojtek (6th)
             Piotrek G. (8th)
-----------  --------------------

A very disappointing performance, involved two spins (1st lap on the 2nd corner and 4th lap on the 3rd) that required pushing out and cost me over a minute in total -- i.e. more than one lap. Other than that I had a couple more spins where I managed to rejoin the race on my own. The kart (no. 2) seemed to skid much more than the one I had in the previous session. The track was full so ther was quite a lot of chaos and overtaking, but overall the biggest issue was my lack of control of the kart in the corners.

#### Observations

* with a skiddy kart like the one in this session wide line on 2nd corner is a must.

### 1st August 2013

-----------  --------------------
Where        Raceway Docklands
Started      4th of 12
Finished     3th of 11
Fastest Lap  0:43.66
-----------  --------------------

Uneventful race, the only overtake was when the guy in front spun, other than that just lapping. Very few karts on the circuit, so most of the time it felt like driving on an empty track. Kart 8.

#### Observations

* The power output at low revs is very low, so it takes a while for the kart to start accellerating. This means full throttle can be applied earlier in the bend as its effect will only be felt after a couple of seconds.
* With very few karts on the circuit wide lines are fine.
* Fastest lap over 5 seconds faster than last time. Was it because of small number of participants, or because of a very hot day (better grip at 31 degrees Celsius)?

### 1st March 2013

-----------  --------------------
Where        Raceway Docklands
Started      8th of 17
Finished     5th of 17
Fastest Lap  0:49.01
Others       Wojtek (6th)
             Grzesiek (7th)
             Ania (14th)
-----------  --------------------

Palms of my hands ached terribly after the race, I must have had them very tense throughout. Most of the times when I was overtaken it was when I approached the corner on a wide line and left enough space inside for someone to sneak through.

#### Observations

Corner approach should depend on whether someone is right behind. If so, the line should be tight to not leave any room to overtake on the inside; otherwise wide to not require as much breaking.
