They had larger eyes than _Homo sapiens_, probably because they inhabited Europe, while _Homo sapiens_ evolved in Africa. There is a theory that larger eyes led to larger part at the back of the brain devoted to visual processing, at the cost of the frontal lobe which is responsible for higher-level thinking and social networking. The theory goes that developed frontal lobe allowed _Homo sapiens_ to fashion warmer clothes and survive the ice age, during which Neanderthals became extinct.
