## dependent

(or paired-subjects test) When measuring the same sample twice: take the difference between results for each individual then average it.

### t-value

*t-value* is defined as *(observed - expected) / standard error*. When applied to [NHST](null hypothesis significance testing) *expected* is 0, so the formua is simplified to

$t=\frac{M}{SE}$

where $M$ is the mean difference between observed values for each subject and $SE$ is the standard error of the differences.

### Effect size

Measured by *Cohen's d*:

$d=\frac{M}{\sigma}$

I.e. "how much did people change in terms of standard deviation?"

### In R

~~~ {.r}
t.test(measurement1, measurement2, paired=T)
cohensD(measurement1, measurement2, method='paired')
~~~

## independent

When measuring difference between two different groups: take difference between mean scores of both groups.


### t-value

*t-value* is again as *(observed - expected) / standard error*, and again for [NHST](null hypothesis significance testing) we take *expected* = 0. However, we now have two samples to compare:

$t=\frac{M_1-M_2}{SE}$

$SE=\frac{SE_1+SE_2}{2}$

### Effect size

$d=\frac{M_1-M_2}{\sigma_{pooled}}$

$\sigma_{pooled}=\frac{\sigma_1+\sigma_2}{2}$

Note: for $\sigma_{pooled}$ to be well defined both groups have to have the same amount of variance. If this assumption is violated the entire test is bogus. The validity of this assumption can be tested with *Lavene's test*:

~~~ {.r}
leveneTest(independentVar ~ dependentVar)
~~~

### In R

~~~ {.r}
t.test(measurement1, measurement2, var.equal=T)
cohensD(measurement1, measurement2, method='pooled')
~~~
