## dependent

(or paired-subjects test) When measuring the same sample twice: take the difference between results for each individual then average it.

### t-value

*t-value* is defined as *(observed - expected) / standard error*. When applied to [NHST](null hypothesis significance testing) *expected* is 0, so the formua is simplified to

$t=\frac{M}{SE}$

where $M$ is the mean observed value and $SE$ is the standard error.

### Effect size

Measured by *Cohen's d*:

$d=\frac{M}{\sigma}$

## independent

When measuring difference between two different groups: take difference between mean scores of both groups.
