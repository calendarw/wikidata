When the periods of two bodies orbiting the same body are multiples of each other ($nP_1=mP_2$). This causes the orbits to deform (elongate) as the bodies are in conjunction always at the same point of their orbits.

A stable resonance configurations can occur. For example, [Cruithne's](Cruithne) period in orbiting the Sun is exactly the same as Earth's. Earth and Sun both control the motion of Cruithne.

A more usual outcome is a destructive perturbation of the orbit. This can be witnessed in the [asteroid belt](solar system) where at certain distances from the Sun no asteroids orbit. These are the orbits that are in resonance with Jupiter and if anything was there its orbit would become less and less circular, leading to collisions and ejection from the system.
