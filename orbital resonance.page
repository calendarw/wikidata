When the periods of two bodies orbiting the same body are multiples of each other ($nP_1=mP_2$). This causes the orbits to deform (elongate) as the bodies are in conjunction always at the same point of their orbits.

A stable resonance configurations can occur. For example, [Cruithne's](Cruithne) period in orbiting the Sun is exactly the same as Earth's.
