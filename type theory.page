* based on Gentzen's proof theory
* types classif admissible forms of construction
* introduction rules "effect" a construction (how to make)
* elimination rules "deconstruct" a construction (how to take it apart)
* inversion principle (or principle of conservation of proof): elim is a post-invers to intro

What (statics): introduction/elimination

How (dynamics): inversion principle

Intention: programmatically encompass all known mathematical constructions in particular forms of proof.
