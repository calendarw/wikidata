====== UTF ======

Unicode: 17 planes, each with 2^16 chars

Encodings for UTF:

====== UTF-8 =====

first bit determines length of char:

0xxxxxx
1011xxx xxxxxxxx
(two more, for 3 and 4 bytes)

===== UTF=16 =====

only two cases: 16 or 32 bits

simpler than 8, soe can be faster to process

===== misc ======

Haskell: String is a linked list of Unicode characters, each character takes a word
