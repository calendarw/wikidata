Some interesting cars:

* Land Rover Discovery -- large, can go on uneven surfaces, but expensive to run
* Ford S-Max -- very versatile, can carry up to 6 passengers, or have a large boot space, nice to drive
* Mazda Bongo -- some cool camper conversions around, but have seen very rusty ones on AutoTrader
