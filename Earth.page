## Structure

Discovered through seismology -- analysis of propagation of sound waves resulting from earthquakes.

* solid metal inner core
* molten metal outer core
* molten rock mantle
* solid rock crust

Inner core is solid despite very high temperature because of extremely high pressure. Circulation of heat within the mantle causes pull on the tectonic plates that form the crust and results in formation of mountains.

Source of heat:

* 80%: radioactive decay in the core
* 20%: contraction of core and resulting release of gravitational energy
