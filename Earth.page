## Structure

Discovered through seismology -- analysis of propagation of sound waves resulting from earthquakes.

* solid metal inner core
* molten metal outer core
* molten rock mantle
* solid rock crust

Inner core is solid despite very high temperature because of extremely high pressure. Circulation of heat within the mantle causes pull on the tectonic plates that form the crust and results in formation of mountains.

Source of heat:

* 80%: radioactive decay in the core
* 20%: contraction of core and resulting release of gravitational energy

## Atmosphere

During [initial formation](solar system) Earth had too little mass to attract and retain the gases that were plentiful -- hydrogen and helium. As the rocks heated up they released N2 and CO2 which formed the initial atmosphere. Later water dissolved CO2 and early bacteria and plants released O2. This was initially oxidising sediments of iron and sulphur but after saturating these it started accumulating in the atmosphere.

Three large convection cells. The direction of winds can be explained by these cells and the [Coriolis effect]().

## Water

Most of the water on Earth was brought in by comets during the heavy bombardment phase of [solar system]() formation.

## Magnetism

Caused by rotation along with convection. The field reverses polarity on average every 500,000 years.
