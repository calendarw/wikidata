Type Ia: when a [white dwarf]() accretes matter so that it approaches [Chandrasekhar limit](), the pressure and temperature increases to the point where Carbon fusion is ignited. Due to [degeneracy](electron degeneracy) the heating does not lead to expansion which causes a violent fusion of substantial fraction of the star in a couple of seconds. Internal temperature exceeds $10^9K$ and $10^{44}J$ of energy is released (as much as a million [novae](nova)). The [luminosity]() reaches $10^{9-10}$ solar luminosities -- about a luminosity of entire galaxy. Spectrum has absorption lines of Si, but little H and He. In the shock wave very heavy elements such as Uranium get formed and  contribute to luminosity over coming months.

The nature of mass donor in case of supernova is unclear: the rate of mass accretion must be so fast that nova does not get a chance to occur. Two potential scenarios: single degenerate (donor is main sequence star or a giant) or double degenerate, where the donor is another white dwarf ripped apart by [tidal forces](tidal force).

Ia type supernovae are good [standard candles](standard candle) since their luminosity (corrected by [light curve]()) is almost the same (and very high): complete fusion of CO object of mass about 1.44 solar masses.
