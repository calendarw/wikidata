If we know the dominant colour of the light emitted by a star then the temperature can be estimated from [Wien's law](black-body%20radiation#wiens-law), but measurement of the intensity at various wavelengths is unreliable since the spectrum is broad and subject to distortion by medium. What is much more reliable are the [spectral lines](spectroscopy). For example absence of hydrogen line can tell us that it's so hot that all hydrogen atoms are ionised or that it's so cold that all atoms are in base state, i.e. absorb in ultraviolet, not blue.

Stars are classified into groups according to their spectra.
