In [quantum mechanics](), a function that is a property of a given particle (e.g. an electron) and maps a position to the probability of finding that particle there.

Why is it not so relevant for large objects? Because $\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$, ($h$ is [Planck's constant]()) so for large mass the momentum is going to be large hence the wave length $\lambda$ very small. Thats's why classical physics works well in macro scale.
