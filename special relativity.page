[Lorentz transformations]() only make sense with $v<c$, so we assume that two observers can never move wrt. each other faster than light.

## Consequences of Lorentz Transformations

* simultainety is relative: $t'=0 \rightarrow t=vx/c^2$
* [length contraction]()
* [time dilation]()
* [Doppler effect]() is different depending on whether object moves tangentially (transversely): $\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ (caused purely by time dilation) or radially away from/towards us (longitudinally): $\lambda=\lambda_0\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$ (caused by time dilation and length contraction).

## Invariant Interval

From [Lorentz](Lorentz transformations): $s^2=c^2t'^2-x'^2=c^2t^2-x^2$

This defines the [light cone](), with inside where $s^2>0$ and outside where $s^2<0$.

## Proper time

Time interval measured by a clock that is present at both start and end event: $\tau=\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{c}}$.
