The triplet $(A\times B, p_1, p_2)$ is a product of *A* and *B* if for every object *C* and arrows *f* and *g* there exists exactly one arrow $<f,g>$ such that this diagram commutes:

~~~ {.dot}
digraph m {
node[shape=none];
C -> A [label=f];
C -> B [label=g];
C -> AxB [label="<f,g>"];
AxB -> A [label=p1];
AxB -> B [label=p2];
}
~~~

In **Set** this corresponds to Cartesian product, and there is a nice explanation of how to generalise set product to this abstract definition in Pierce's book.

The [dual](categorical duals) is [coproduct]().
