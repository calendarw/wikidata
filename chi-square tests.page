categories: statistics
...

Used when dependent variable is categorical, e.g. the polio vaccine tests, election polls.

## Goodness of fit statistic

Null hypothesis: the results are split equally between all output categories.

$\chi^2 = \sum{\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}}$

where $O$ -- observed frequency, $E$ -- expected ($\frac{1}{n}$ for [NHST](null hypothesis significance testing))

## Test of independence

Is there a relationship between two categorical variables? E.g. relationship ("contingency") between the gender of the voter and the candidate they prefer?

Null hypothesis: there is no relationship.

$\chi^2$ formula is the same as for goodness of fit, but degrees of freedom are calculated differently:

degrees of freedom = (number ofrows -1) $\times$ (number of columns - 1)

## Effect size

Cramer's V (or $\Phi$):

$\Phi_C=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{N(k-1)}}$

Where $N$ -- sample size, $k$ -- number of categories (differs for fit and independence tests)

## In R

~~~ {.r}
# fit
observed <- table(poll$candidate)
chisq.test(observed)

# independence
observed <- table(poll$candidate, poll$gender)
chisq.test(observed)
~~~
