categories: statistics
...

Used when dependent variable is categorical, e.g. the polio vaccine tests, election polls.

## Goodness of fit statistic

Null hypothesis: the results are split equally between all output categories.

$\chi^2 = \sum{\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}}$

where $O$ -- observed frequency, $E$ -- expected ($\frac{1}{n}$ for [NHST](null hypothesis significance testing))

### Effect size

Cramer's V (or $\Phi$).

## Test of independence

Is there a relationship between two categorical variables? E.g. relationship between the gender of the voter and the candidate they prefer?

## In R

~~~ {.r}
observed <- table(poll$candidate)
chisq.test(observed)
~~~
