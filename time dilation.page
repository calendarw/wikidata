The effect of time periods between two clock ticks when the clock is moving at [relativistic velocity](special relativity) being longer than what would be measured if the object was stationary. The magnitude can be calculated from [Lorentz transformations]().

Experimental evidence: 

* uwhen nstable particles with short lifespans are accellerated close to the speed of light they last forever.
* atomic clock on a jet that circumnavigated the globe a couple of times was behind the clock that was left on the runway.
