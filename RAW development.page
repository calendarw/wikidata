## Tools

### Tone mapping

#### Tone curve

Maps input luminosity (?) to output. Very useful, e.g. allows to make both clouds on light sky and items in the shade visible.

### Colour

#### Colour zones

Allows to modify lightness, saturation and hue for different colours in the picture. Useful e.g. for making black+white+red pictures.

### Enhancements

#### Equalizer

Very useful for smoothing out skin: denoise preset.

## HDR

The main tool that gives the familiar overdone HDR appearance, with light halos, is "shadows and highlights"; moving the "shadows" slider to the right increases brightness of dark areas and the halos around them.
