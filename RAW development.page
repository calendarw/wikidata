### Tone mapping

#### Tone curve

Maps input luminosity (?) to output. Very useful, e.g. allows to make both clouds on light sky and items in the shade visible.

### Colour

#### Colour zones

Allows to modify lightness, saturation and hue for different colours in the picture. Useful e.g. for making black+white+red pictures.
