## Setup

~~~ 
sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/nvidia-313-updates
cabal install accelerate-cuda
~~~

### Troubleshooting

* `cabal install` fails a number of times when it can't find compiled programs such as `happy`, `alex` and `c2hs`. Needed to `cabal install` these separately.
* `configure: error: could not find CUDA driver library` -- happened when `/usr/lib/nvidia-313-current` (the directory containing `libcuda.so`) wasn't added to linker paths.
