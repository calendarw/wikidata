## Setup

* `sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`
* `cabal install accelerate-cuda`

### Troubleshooting

* `cabal install` fails a number of times when it can't find compiled programs such as `happy`, `alex` and `c2hs`. Needed to `cabal install` these separately.
* `configure: error: could not find CUDA driver library` -- stuck at this currently

So far figured out that when building CUDA samples I needed to set `LD_PATH` to `/usr/lib/nvidia-313-current`, because that's where `libcuda.so` is on my system. Setting `--extra-lib-paths` on cabal hasn't helped though.
