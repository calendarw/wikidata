A statistical technique for predicting values of random variable assuming its relationship with underlying variable is linear. _Simple regression_ refers to a situation where there is just one underlying variable; if there are multiple we are talking about _multiple regression_.

## Formula

### Simple Regression

If we are predicting variable $Y$ from $X$:

TODO

where

$B_i=r\times \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}

Where $r$ is the [Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]().

## in R

A simple example, after [http://msenux.redwoods.edu/math/R/regression.php]():

~~~ { .r }
age <- 18:29
height <- c(76.1, 77, 78.1, 78.2, 78.8, 79.7, 79.9, 81.1, 81.2, 81.8, 82.8, 83.5)
# find coefficients:
line = lm(height ~ age)
# plot the points:
plot(age, height)
# plot the line:
abline(line)
~~~
