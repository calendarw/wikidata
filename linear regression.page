A statistical technique for predicting values of random variable assuming its relationship with underlying variable is linear.

## in R

A simple example, after [http://msenux.redwoods.edu/math/R/regression.php]():

~~~ { .r }
age <- 18:29
height <- c(76.1, 77, 78.1, 78.2, 78.8, 79.7, 79.9, 81.1, 81.2, 81.8, 82.8, 83.5)
# find coefficients:
line = lm(height ~ age)
# plot the points:
plot(age, height)
# plot the line:
abline(line)
~~~
