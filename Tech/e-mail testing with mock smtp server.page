====== E-mail Testing with Mock SMTP Server ======

If our application can send e-mail (and, according to [[http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000749.html|Letts' Law]], it eventually will), we would want our [[tech:integration_testing_with_teamcity|integration tests]] to verify that the e-mail has indeed been sent, and that its contents are as expected. If we have written the integration tests in Python this will be pretty straightforward: Python library provides ''smtpd'' package with an implementation of SMTP server class, all we need to do is extend it to store the received messages and provide a way for the test code to verify that message has indeed been received. The Mock server class presented below runs in a separate thread and can be started and interrogated from existing test scripts.

<code python smtpmock.py>
'''
Provides a mock SMTP server implementation, MockSMTPServer.

Sample usage:
----
# create the server -- will start automatically
import smtpmock
mock_server = smtpmock.MockSMTPServer("localhost", 25025)

#send a test message
import smtplib
client = smtplib.SMTP("localhost", 25025)
fromaddr = "test.sender@mydomain.com"
toaddrs = ["test.recipient1@mydomain.com", "test.recipient2@mydomain.com"]
content = "test message content"
msg = "From: %s\r\nTo: %s\r\n\r\n%s" % (fromaddr, ", ".join(toaddrs), content)
client.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)
client.quit()

# verify that the message has been recieved
assert(mock_server.received_message_matching("From: .*\\nTo: .*\\n+.+tent"))

# reset the server to be ready for a new test
mock_server.reset()
assert(mock_server.received_messages_count() == 0)
