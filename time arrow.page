====== Time Arrow ======

The direction in which time flows. Per [[A Brief History of Time]], there are three: thermodynamic (direction in which entropy increases), psychological (as perceived by humans) and cosmological (direction in which the universe expands). [[Stephen Hawking]] argues that the first two must be consistent due to the way (computer) memory works.

He says further, that assuming the universe has no space-time boundary, in the contracting phase there would be no well-defined thermodynamic arrow, hence the conditions would be unsuitable for intelligent life ([[weak anthropic principle]]).
