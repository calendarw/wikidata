Band structure marks [convection cells]().

## Structure

We can't observe with any instruments below the atmosphere because of its thickness. We can only conjencture based on external observation. It's expected that there is a ball of metallic hydrogen of radius more than a half of the planet's radius. Inside there is Earth-sized core formed of rock and ice.
