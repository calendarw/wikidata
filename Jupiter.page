Band structure marks [convection cells]().

Giant red spot the size of [Earth]() -- a storm that has been going on for 100 thousand years.

Has strong magnetic field.

## Structure

We can't observe with any instruments below the atmosphere because of its thickness. We can only conjencture based on external observation. It's expected that there is a ball of metallic hydrogen of radius more than a half of the planet's radius. Inside there is Earth-sized core formed of rock and ice.

## Missions

* Galileo orbiter dropped a probe into the atmosphere. The probe lasted for about an hour and finally perished at level where the pressure was 22 bar and temperature 400K. During this time it travelled approx. 600 km into the atmosphere.

## Observations

Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 disintegrated and crashed into Jupiter, that provided good opportunity to monitor the movements in Jovian atmosphere.
