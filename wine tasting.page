## Look

* **age**: whites darken with age, become brown; reds lighten, become amber -- this is a result of oxidation. With red, tilt the glass and look how the colour changes towards the edge of the liquid. In young wines it will be solid, in older the gradient from red towards amber will be visible.
* **clarity**: nowadays pretty much all wines are clear thanks to the production process. Older reds can have visible tannin deposit. Some whites (esp. German) might contain crystals that look like sugar. This is tartaric acid, and it's usually a good sign -- means the wine has not been cold-stabilised.
