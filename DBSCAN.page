A clustering algorithm that has various advantages over popular [k-means](), among them lack of sensitivity to starting conditions, no need for upfront definition of the number of clusters and ability to detect clusters that are not linearly separable.

## The Algorithm

Choose ε distance;
While there are points that are not assigned to clusters (or rejected):

* choose one unassigned point
* mark all points within ε from that point as belonging to the same cluster as the starting point
