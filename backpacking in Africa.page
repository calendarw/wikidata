## Summary

* forget timekeeping: transportation options are limited and unreliable
* prices for tourists are inflated so might turn out relatively expensive
* south and east more interesting to begin with
* pick two-four countries at most: distances are huge, transportation unreliable and crossing borders not as easy as in some other places (remember about visas!)
