Part of `System.IO`, e.g. `hGetContents`.

Criticised for lack of control over resource usage. However, Andres Löh said it might be OK for simple network apps.

## Iteratees

Concept by [Oleg Kiselyov](http://okmij.org/ftp/Streams.html). Difficult to understand. There is a couple of implementations on Hackage.

## IO Streams

Released in [March 2013](http://snapframework.com/blog/2013/03/05/announcing-io-streams) by the authors of Snap web framework. Advertised as simple and efficient. 

Criticised by Paul Chiusano:
