A "functional" package manager.

## Basics

Packages are stored in `/nix/store`, each in directory whose name contains the hash of all its dependencies. This ensures that different versions of libraries and apps can be installed alongside each other.

Since applications are not stored in the usual locations such as `/usr/local/bin`, how are binaries found for a given user?

~~~
> echo $PATH
...:/home/mmakowski/.nix-profile/bin:...
> ls -l /home/mmakowski/.nix-profile/bin
...
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root nixbld   67 Jan  1  1970 sublime -> /nix/store/7npfiweroafjawoeifp32r3ppjp2-sublimetext-2.0.1/bin/sublime
...
~~~

How do these applications in turn find the libraries they depend on? TODO

What if we upgrade a package and the old version is not used any more? It's left there inc case we wanted to roll back, but can be removed if we run `nix-collect-garbage`.

Default deployment model is building from source; however, Nix channels can provide pre-built binaries.
