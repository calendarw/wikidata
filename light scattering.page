Identified by lord Rayleigh.

Shorter wave lengths scatter more than longer ones. That's why the sky appears blue and Sun appears yellow. Raising and setting sun is red because it goes through more scatterers -- thicker atmosphere and 
more scatterers at low altitudes.

## Moon Halo

Hexagonal ice crystals in high-altitude clouds scatter at 22 degrees producing the halo.

## Rainbow

Best are at sunset and sunrise. Water droplets scatter at 140 degrees.
