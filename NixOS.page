Andres LÃ¶h used on his netbook, so must be usable.

## Installation

### Via USB

After http://nixos.org/wiki/Installing_NixOS_from_a_USB_stick

* download the mini .iso
* install unetbootin
* find USB stick with sufficient capacity and format it to FAT32 (gparted)
* write iso to USB stick with unetbootin. Gotchas: didn't work on desktop with USB3 (no files were written)
* in EeePC: make sure that USB drive appears before internal HDD in bios hard drives list
* reboot, start NixOs install, login as root with empty password
* on EeePC: can't use wifi, Broadcom BCM4313 requires `wl` kernel module, but no such module is available in NixOS install
