Given period and radius of the orbit we can find the mass of the system:

$\frac{M_1+M_2}{M_{sun}}=\left(\frac{R}{1AU}\right)^3\left(\frac{P}{1y}\right)^{-2}$

If we know the radia at which both of the planets orbit the centre of mass:

$M_1R_1=M_2R_2$

And from these two equations we can find individual masses of the stars.
