## Measuring Masses

Given period and radius of the orbit we can find the mass of the system:

$\frac{M_1+M_2}{M_{sun}}=\left(\frac{R}{1AU}\right)^3\left(\frac{P}{1y}\right)^{-2}$

If we know the radia at which both of the planets orbit the centre of mass:

$M_1R_1=M_2R_2$

And from these two equations we can find individual masses of the stars.

## Spectroscopic Binaries

Some binary systems are indistinguishable visually, but [spectroscopy]() to the rescue! If we find periodic shifts of lines that move in oposite directions then it suggests a binary system. We can measure $v1$, $v2$ and $P$ directly from the spectrum (note: $v$s are only radial components of velocity). Then:

$R_{i}=\frac{v_{i}P}{2\pi}$

$M=M_1+M_2=M_1\frac{v_2 + v_1}{v_2}$ (because $M_1v_1=M_2v_2$)

$M_1=\frac{v_2P}{2\pi G}(v_1+v_2)^2$

Or, relative to [Sun]():

$M_1=\frac{P}{1y}\ \frac{v_2(v_1+v_2)^2}{(29.78 km/s)^3}M_{sun}$
