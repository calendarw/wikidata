Tides are a result of the [centripetal acceleration]() of the point on the surface of the Earth that is far from another body (say, moon) being different than that on the opposite side of the Earth. The tidal force "elongates" the body: the points closer to another body have higher acceleration (are "pulled towards") while the points further are "pushed away".

The tidal force exerted on Earth by the moon is approximately 2 times larger than that exerted by the sun. The two are aligned during full moon and new moon, so that's when the tidal force is the highest and sea tides are most pronounced ("spring tides"). During quarter moon the difference is the smallest ("neap tides").

Due to the tidal force working on both the near and far side of the Earth the high tide happens twice a day, 12 hours 24 mins apart.
