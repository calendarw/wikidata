When [solar wind]() is particularly strong (e.g. during a solar storm) the charged particles penetrate through the shield of [Earth's magnetic field](Earth) and ionise the gas in the atmosphere, which in turn starts to glow. This happens near the poles, where the magnetic field lines enter the atmosphere. Aurora Australis is over Antarctica and Aurora Borealis over Arctic.
