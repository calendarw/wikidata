A measure of average random motion of atoms and molecules in an object.

## [Ideal Gas](ideal gas)

$\left<\frac{mv^2}{2}\right>=\frac{3}{2}k_BT$

where $k_B$ is [Boltzmann constant]() and angle brackets signify the average value.

## A Planet

From [Stefan-Boltzmann relation](https://notepad.mmakowski.com/black-body%20radiation#stefan-boltzmann-relation) and the formula for [luminosity]() we can estimate the equilibrium temperature -- temperature at which the body receives the same amount of energy from star irradiation as it emits:

$T_e=T_{star}\sqrt{\frac{R_{star}}{2D}}$

Note that it only depends on the properties of the start and the distance $D$ from the star. Also it does not take into account the [albedo]() and atmosphere (if any) of the body in question.

## A Star

See [temperature of the surface of the sun]().
