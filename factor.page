## Creating a vocabulary

In scratchpad:

~~~
USE: tools.scaffold
"resource:work" "<vocabulary name>" scaffold-vocab
USE: <vocabulary name>
~~~

now open `c:/program files/factor/work/<vocabulary name>/<vocabulary name>.factor` in editor and write the code. It can be tested interactively in scratchpad.

## Creating unit tests

In scratchpad:
~~~
"<vocabulary name>" scaffold-tests
~~~

now open `c:/program files/factor/work/<vocabulary name>/<vocabulary name>-tests.factor` in editor and add:
~~~
[ <expected stack> ] [ <sequence to test> ] unit-test
~~~
`C-c C-t` in `<vocabulary name>.factor` runs the tests
